description: Aegon is a life insurance and long-term savings business listed in the
    Netherlands. It listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in the 1980s and now has
    mature operations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and four growth markets
    of Brazil, China, Portugal, and Spain. Over recent years, Aegon has been moving
    through an extensive transformation program where management has sought to divest
    noncore operations and improve the risk profile of the business. Financial assets
    are the parts of the group that are now being run off. Aegon is looking to cycle
    out of capital-consumptive and volatile-earnings products and recycle funds into
    capital-light and more predictable strategic businesses.
