description: Founded in 1978, Banco Santander Chile is part of Santander Group and
    majority-controlled by Santander Spain. It is the largest bank in Chile by loans
    and the second largest by deposits. The bank generates most of its net interest
    income (roughly 65% of total revenue) from its mortgages, unsecured consumer credit
    lines, and commercial loans. Banco Santander's commercial loan business is more
    focused on small- to medium-size companies, with firms generating more than CLP
    10,000 million in revenue only making up around 5% of outstanding loans. Outside
    of lending, Banco Santander is the largest card issuer in the country with around
    25% of the market and benefits from a long-term strategic partnership with the
    largest airline in the country, LATAM.
