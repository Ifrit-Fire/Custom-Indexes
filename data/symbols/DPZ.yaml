description: Domino's is a restaurant operator and franchiser with nearly 21,400 global
    stores across more than 90 international markets at the end of the first quarter
    of 2025. The firm generates revenue through the sales of pizza, wings, salads,
    sandwiches, and desserts at company-owned stores, royalty and marketing contributions
    from franchise-operated stores, and its network of 25 domestic (and five Canadian)
    dough manufacturing and supply chain facilities, which centralize purchasing,
    preparation, and last-mile delivery for the firm's US and Canadian restaurants.
    With roughly $19.2 billion in 2024 system sales, Domino's is the largest player
    in the global pizza market, ahead of Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, and narrow-moat
    Papa John's.
