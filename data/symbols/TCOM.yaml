description: Trip.com is the largest online travel agent in China and is positioned
    to benefit from the country's rising demand for higher-margin outbound travel
    as passport penetration is only 12% in China. The company generated about 79%
    of sales from accommodation reservations and transportation ticketing in 2024.
    The rest of revenue comes from package tours and corporate travel. Before the
    pandemic in 2019, the company generated 25% of revenue from international travel,
    which is important to its margin expansion. Most of sales come from its domestic
    platform, but the company is expanding its overseas business. The competes in
    a crowded OTA industry in China, including Meituan, Alibaba-backed Fliggy, Tongcheng,
    and Qunar. The company was founded in 1999 and listed on the Nasdaq in December
    2003.
