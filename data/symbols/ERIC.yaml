description: 'Ericsson provides telecom equipment and services that are primarily
    used to build and operate mobile networks. The firm divides its business into
    three segments: networks, cloud and software services, and enterprise. Wireless
    carriers have traditionally been the firm''s primary customers, but it is pushing
    to cater more to enterprises as well, as both try to take advantage of 5G capabilities
    and utilize "as-a-service" communications platforms. The company also licenses
    its patents to handset manufacturers.'
