description: ResMed is one of the largest respiratory care device companies globally,
    primarily developing and supplying flow generators, masks and accessories for
    the treatment of sleep apnea. Increasing diagnosis of sleep apnea combined with
    ageing populations and increasing prevalence of obesity is resulting in a structurally
    growing market. The company earns roughly two thirds of its revenue in the Americas
    and the balance across other regions dominated by Europe, Japan and Australia.
    Recent developments and acquisitions have focused on digital health as ResMed
    is aiming to differentiate itself through the provision of clinical data for use
    by the patient, medical care advisor and payer in the out-of-hospital setting.
