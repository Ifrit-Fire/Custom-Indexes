description: Created from the international operations of Altria in 2008, Philip Morris
    International sells cigarettes and reduced-risk products, including heat sticks,
    vapes, and oral nicotine offerings, primarily outside of the US. With the 2023
    acquisition of Swedish Match, a leading manufacturer of traditional oral tobacco
    products and nicotine pouches primarily in the US and Scandinavia, PMI has not
    only diversified away from smokable products but also gained a toehold in the
    US to sell its Iqos heated tobacco product.
