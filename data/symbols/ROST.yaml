description: Ross Stores operates as an off-price apparel and accessories retailer
    with the majority of its sales derived from its Ross Dress for Less banner. The
    company opportunistically procures excess brand-name merchandise made available
    via manufacturing overruns and retail liquidation sales at a 20%-60% discount
    to full prices. As such, its stores are often filled with a vast array of stock-keeping
    units, each with minimal product depth that creates a treasure hunt shopping experience.
    The firm's more than 1,800 Ross Dress for Less stores are primarily located in
    densely populated suburban communities and typically serve middle-income consumers.
    Ross also operates around 350 DD's Discounts chains targeting lower-income shoppers.
