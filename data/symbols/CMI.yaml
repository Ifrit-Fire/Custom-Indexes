description: Cummins is a leading manufacturer of diesel and other engines used in
    heavy- and medium-duty commercial trucks, off-highway equipment, and locomotives,
    in addition to prime power and standby generators. The company also sells powertrain
    components, which include filtration products, transmissions, turbochargers, aftertreatment
    systems, and fuel systems. Sales are approximately 60% US and Canada and 40% rest
    of the world. Much of Cummins' foreign sales (China, India, and so forth) are
    through joint ventures. The company operates 650 distributors and over 19,000
    dealer locations across 190 countries. Cummins' business model is unique as it
    competes with many of its heavy-duty truck manufacturer customers, which also
    make their own engines.
