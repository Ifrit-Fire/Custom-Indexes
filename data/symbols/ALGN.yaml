description: Align Technology is the leading manufacturer of clear aligners. Invisalign,
    its main product, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998 and
    has since dominated, controlling over 90% of the market. Invisalign can treat
    roughly 90% of all malocclusion cases (misaligned teeth), and there are over 230,000
    Invisalign-trained dentists and orthodontists. In 2022, Invisalign treated over
    2 million cases, or roughly 10% of all orthodontic cases for the year, and it
    has treated over 14 million patients since its launch. Align also sells intraoral
    scanners under the brand iTero, which captures digital impressions of patients'
    teeth and illustrates treatment plans. Over 85% of Invisalign cases are submitted
    by digital scans, and iTero scans make up over half of these scans.
