description: Elevance Health remains one of the leading health insurers in the US,
    providing medical benefits to 46 million medical members as of June 2025. The
    company offers employer, individual, and government-sponsored coverage plans.
    Elevance differs from its peers in its unique position as the largest single provider
    of Blue Cross Blue Shield branded coverage, operating as the licensee for the
    Blue Cross Blue Shield Association in 14 states. Through acquisitions, such as
    the Amerigroup deal in 2012 and MMM in 2021, Elevance's reach expands beyond those
    states through government-sponsored programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare Advantage
    plans, too. It is also an emerging player in pharmacy benefit management and other
    healthcare services.
