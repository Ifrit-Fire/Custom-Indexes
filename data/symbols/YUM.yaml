description: 'Yum Brands is a US-based restaurant operator featuring a portfolio of
    four brands: KFC (31,981 global units at year-end 2024), Pizza Hut (20,225 units),
    Taco Bell (8,757 units), and Habit Burger & Grill (nearly 400 units). With more
    than $65 billion in 2024 systemwide sales, the firm is the second-largest restaurant
    company in the world behind McDonald''s ($131 billion). Yum is 98% franchised,
    with the largest franchisee, Yum China, spun out in 2016, after which Yum China
    agreed to pay 3% royalties to Yum Brands in perpetuity. Yum is the newest evolution
    of Tricon, formerly a division of PepsiCo, and generates the bulk of its revenue
    from franchise royalties and marketing contributions.'
