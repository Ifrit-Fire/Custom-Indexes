description: Eni is an integrated oil and gas company that explores for, produces,
    and refines oil around the world. In 2023, the company produced 0.8 million barrels
    of liquids and 4.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. At end-2023, Eni
    held reserves of 6.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 48% of which are liquids.
    The Italian government owns a 30.1% stake in the company. Eni is placing its renewable
    and low-carbon business in a separate entity called Plentitude, which it will
    likely list publicly at some point.
