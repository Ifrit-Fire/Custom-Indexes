description: With over $41 billion in consolidated 2024 sales, Best Buy is the largest
    pure-play consumer electronics retailer in the US, boasting roughly 8% share of
    the North American market and around 33% share of offline sales in the region,
    per our calculations, CTA, and Euromonitor data. The firm generates the bulk of
    its sales in-store, with mobile phones and tablets, computers, and appliances
    representing its three largest categories. Recent investments in e-commerce fulfillment,
    accelerated by the covid pandemic, have seen the US e-commerce channel roughly
    double from prepandemic levels, with management estimating that it will represent
    a mid-30% proportion of sales moving forward.
