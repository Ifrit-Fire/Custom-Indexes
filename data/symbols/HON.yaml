description: 'Honeywell traces its roots to 1885 with Albert Butz''s firm, Butz Thermo-Electric
    Regulator, which produced a predecessor to the modern thermostat. Other inventions
    by Honeywell include biodegradable detergent and autopilot. Today, Honeywell is
    a global multi-industry behemoth with one of the largest installed bases of equipment.
    It operates through four business segments: aerospace technologies (37% of 2023
    company revenue), industrial automation (29%), energy and sustainability solutions
    (17%), and building automation (17%). Recently, Honeywell has made several portfolio
    changes to focus on fewer end markets and align with a set of secular growth trends.
    The firm is working diligently to expand its installed base, deriving around 30%
    of its revenue from recurring aftermarket services.'
