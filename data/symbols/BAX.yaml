description: Baxter offers a variety of medical supplies and equipment to providers.
    From its legacy operations, Baxter sells injectable therapies for use in care
    settings, including IV pumps, administrative sets, and solutions; nutritional
    products; and surgical sealants and hemostatic agents. Baxter expanded its portfolio
    of hospital-focused offerings by acquiring Hillrom in late 2021, which added basic
    equipment like hospital beds, operating room equipment, and patient monitoring
    tools to the portfolio. Baxter also sold its kidney care tools in early 2025.
