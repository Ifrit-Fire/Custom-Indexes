description: Newmont is the world's largest gold miner. It bought Goldcorp in 2019,
    combined its Nevada mines in a joint venture with competitor Barrick later that
    year, and also purchased competitor Newcrest in November 2023. Its portfolio includes
    17 wholly or majority owned mines and interests in two joint ventures in the Americas,
    Africa, Australia and Papua New Guinea. The company is expected to sell roughly
    5.6 million ounces of gold in 2025 from its core mines after selling six higher-cost,
    smaller mines. Newmont also produces material amounts of copper, silver, zinc,
    and lead as byproducts. It had about two decades of gold reserves along with significant
    byproduct reserves at the end of December 2024.
