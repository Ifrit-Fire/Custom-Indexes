description: Kinross Gold is a Canada-based gold producer, producing roughly 2.1 million
    gold equivalent ounces in 2024. The company had about a decade of gold reserves
    at the end of 2024. It operates mines in the Americas and West Africa after selling
    its low-cost Russian operations in 2022 in response to the invasion of Ukraine.
    The company has historically used acquisitions to fuel expansion into new regions
    and production growth. In 2022, Kinross purchased the Great Bear project in Canada.
    If developed as we think likely, it could produce an average of more than 500,000
    ounces of gold per year for at least a decade, with its unit cash costs likely
    in the first quartile of the industry cost curve.
