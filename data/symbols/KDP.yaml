description: Keurig Dr Pepper was established in 2018 following a merger between Keurig
    Green Mountain Coffee and Dr Pepper Snapple. The company manufactures and distributes
    coffee systems (including coffee brewers and single-serve coffee pods) under the
    Keurig and Green Mountain brands, as well as ready-to-drink beverages including
    flavored (non-cola) sparkling soft drinks under well-known brands such as Dr Pepper,
    Snapple, and Canada Dry. The company controls production and route to market for
    its own brands through in-house manufacturing plants and distribution infrastructure
    and leverages these facilities to manufacture and distribute for third-party coffee
    and beverage brands via licensing and partnership agreements. The US and Canada
    make up 95% of revenue, with the rest from Mexico.
