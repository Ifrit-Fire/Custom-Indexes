description: GE Aerospace is the global leader in designing, manufacturing, and servicing
    commercial aircraft engines, along with partner Safran in their CFM joint venture.
    With its massive global installed base of nearly 70,000 commercial and military
    engines, GE Aerospace earns most of its profits on recurring service revenue of
    that equipment, which operates for decades. GE Aerospace is the remaining core
    business of the company formed in 1892 with historical ties to American inventor
    Thomas Edison; that company became a storied conglomerate with peak revenue of
    $130 billion in 2000 until GE spun off its appliance, finance, healthcare, and
    wind and power businesses between 2016 and 2024.
