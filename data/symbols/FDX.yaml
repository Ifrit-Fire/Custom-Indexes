description: "FedEx pioneered overnight delivery in 1973 and remains the world's largest\
    \ express package provider. In fiscal 2025, the firm's Federal Express segment\u2014\
    which houses the core package delivery operations\u2014made up 86% of total revenue,\
    \ with 10% coming from FedEx Freight, its asset-based less-than-truckload shipping\
    \ segment. The remainder came from other services, including FedEx Office, which\
    \ provides document production/shipping, and FedEx Logistics, which provides global\
    \ forwarding. FedEx acquired Dutch parcel delivery firm TNT Express in 2016, boosting\
    \ its presence across Europe. TNT was previously the fourth-largest global parcel\
    \ delivery provider."
