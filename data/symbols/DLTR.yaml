description: Dollar Tree operates discount stores across the United States and Canada,
    with over 8,800 shops under its namesake banner. About 50% of Dollar Tree's sales
    in fiscal 2024 were consumables (including food, health and beauty, and cleaning
    products), around 45% variety items (including toys and homewares), and 5% seasonal
    items. Dollar Tree sells most of its merchandise at the $1.25 price point and
    positions its stores in well-populated suburban markets. The retailer has agreed
    to sell Family Dollar (with about 7,000 stores) to private equity investors for
    $1 billion.
