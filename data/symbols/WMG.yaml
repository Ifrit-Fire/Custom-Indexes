description: Warner Music is the third-largest of the three major record companies.
    Recorded music accounts for most of the firm's revenue, with the segment housing
    notable record labels including Atlantic Records, Warner Records, Elektra Records.
    Some of the most successful current artists signed to record deals with Warner
    include Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, Cardi B, and Dua Lipa. Warner's remaining revenue
    comes from its publishing business, where Warner Chappell represents more than
    180,000 songwriters and composers, some of whom are also Warner recording artists
    but many of whom are not recording artists or are attached to other labels. Warner
    Chappell controls more than 1 million musical compositions. Access Industries
    controls 98% of Warner's voting rights, while holding a 72% economic interest.
