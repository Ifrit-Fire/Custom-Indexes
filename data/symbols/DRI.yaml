description: 'Darden Restaurants is the largest restaurant operator in the US full-service
    space, with consolidated revenue of $12.1 billion in fiscal 2025. The company
    maintains a portfolio of 11 restaurant brands: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse,
    Cheddar''s Scratch Kitchen, Ruth''s Chris, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons
    52, Eddie V''s, Bahama Breeze, The Capital Burger, and most recently, Chuy''s.
    Darden generates revenue almost exclusively from company-owned restaurants, though
    a small network of franchised restaurants and consumer-packaged goods sales through
    the traditional grocery channel contribute modestly. As of the end of its fiscal
    2025, the company operated 2,159 restaurants in the US.'
