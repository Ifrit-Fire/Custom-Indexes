description: With more than 20,000 locations, Dollar General's banner is nearly ubiquitous
    across the rural United States. Dollar General serves as a convenient shopping
    destination for fill-in store trips, with its value proposition most relevant
    to consumers in small communities with a dearth of shopping options. The retailer
    operates a frugal store of about 7,500 square feet and primarily offers an assortment
    of branded and private-label consumable items (80% of net sales) such as paper
    and cleaning products, packaged food, and health and beauty items at low prices.
    Dollar General also offers a limited assortment of seasonal merchandise, home
    products, and apparel. The firm sells most items at a price point of $10 or less.
