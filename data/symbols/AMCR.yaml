description: Amcor is a global producer of plastic packaging primarily for the fast-moving
    consumer goods industry. About 90% of earnings are exposed to the flexible packaging
    business. This is soft disposable plastic for a variety of food, drink, healthcare,
    and hygiene products. The remainder of earnings are from the Latin and North American
    rigids business, which is primarily beverage bottling for the soft drink industry.
    Operating in more than 35 countries, Amcor has market share in its established
    regions of North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. About half
    of group sales are derived from North America and the remainder is split equally
    between Western Europe and emerging markets. Australia and New Zealand sales make
    up less than 5% of group sales.
