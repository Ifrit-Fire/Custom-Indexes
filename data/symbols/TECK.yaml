description: Teck is a base metals miner with copper and zinc operations in Canada,
    the United States, Chile, and Peru. After selling its metallurgical coal business,
    copper is now its major commodity by EBITDA contribution, followed by zinc. Teck
    is a top-three zinc miner. Its major new copper mine in Chile at the majority-owned
    Quebrada Blanca 2, in partnership with Sumitomo, will drive an increase in Teck's
    attributable copper production by roughly 75%. Along with a number of additional
    copper growth options, Teck's strategy is to rebalance its portfolio to low-carbon
    metals such as copper. It sold its oil sands business in early 2023 and its coal
    business in mid-2024.
