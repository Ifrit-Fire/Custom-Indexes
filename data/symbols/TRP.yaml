description: TC Energy operates natural gas transmission assets across North America.
    Segments are determined by country of operation, but both Canadian and US operations
    are interconnected. Mexican operations are disconnected from the US and only have
    one customer, the state utility CFE. They also operate power generation assets,
    with the largest being the Bruce Power nuclear plant.
