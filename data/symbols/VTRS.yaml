description: Viatris was formed in November 2020 through the combination of Upjohn,
    a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer that specialized in off-patent drugs, and
    Mylan, a global pharmaceutical manufacturer that focused on generic and specialty
    drugs. By joining forces, Viatris became one of the largest generic drug manufacturers
    in the world, servicing over 165 countries. Generics (commoditized and complex)
    and biosimilars make up roughly 40% of Viatris' total sales. The remaining 60%
    of sales are derived from its portfolio of legacy products, which includes Lipitor,
    Norvasc, Lyrica, and Viagra. While it covers more than 10 major therapeutic areas,
    Viatris has identified dermatology, ophthalmology, and gastroenterology as its
    three key areas of focus for future innovations.
