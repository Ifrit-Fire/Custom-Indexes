description: Roblox operates a free-to-play online video game platform with about
    85 million daily active users. This platform has spawned a virtual universe and
    a Roblox economy based on the Robux currency. The platform houses millions of
    games from a wide range of creators spanning from young gamers themselves to professional
    development studios. Roblox offers creators the tools, publishing abilities, and
    platform for their games, enabling anyone to create a game. Creators earn money
    when gamers make optional in-game purchases within their games and by offering
    space for real-world advertising, and Roblox earns revenue primarily by taking
    a cut of these earnings.
