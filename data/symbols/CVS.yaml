description: CVS Health offers a diverse set of healthcare services. Its roots are
    in its retail pharmacy operations, where it operates over 9,000 stores primarily
    in the US. CVS is also a large pharmacy benefit manager (acquired through Caremark),
    processing about 2 billion adjusted claims annually. It operates a top-tier health
    insurer (acquired through Aetna) through which it serves about 27 million medical
    members. The acquisition of Oak Street Health adds primary care services to the
    mix, which could have significant synergies with all existing business lines.
