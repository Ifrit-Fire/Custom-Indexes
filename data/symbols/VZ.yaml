description: Wireless services account for nearly 75% of Verizon Communications' total
    service revenue and nearly all of its operating income. The firm serves about
    93 million postpaid and 20 million prepaid phone customers via its nationwide
    network, making it the largest US wireless carrier. Fixed-line telecom operations
    include local networks in the Northeast, which reach about 30 million homes and
    businesses, including about 20 million with the Fios fiber optic network. These
    networks serve about 8 million broadband customers. Verizon also provides telecom
    services nationwide to enterprise customers, often using a mixture of its own
    and other carriers' networks. Verizon agreed to acquire Frontier Communications
    in September 2024.
