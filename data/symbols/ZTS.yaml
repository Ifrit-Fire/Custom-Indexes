description: Zoetis sells anti-infectives, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, and
    other health products for animals. The firm earns roughly 35% of total revenue
    from production animals (cattle, pigs, poultry, and so on), and nearly 65% from
    companion animal (dogs, horses, cats) products. Its us business is skewed even
    more heavily toward companion animals, while its international business is slightly
    skewed toward production animals. The firm has the largest market share in the
    industry and was previously Pfizer's animal health unit.
