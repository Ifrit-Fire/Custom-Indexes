description: Haleon is one of the largest consumer health companies in the world.
    Formed by a combination of consumer health divisions of GSK, Pfizer, and Novartis,
    Haleon separated from GSK and went public in July 2022. The firm generates 60%
    of sales from global power brands including Sensodyne, Advil, Centrum, and Poligrip,
    that play in many geographies and are often leaders in their respective categories.
    It also has a number of local brands, including Emergen-C, Eno, Tums, and Caltrate,
    that are more tailored to regional needs and have strong local brand equity. Overall,
    Haleon's brands tackle a variety of silos within consumer health including oral
    care, digestive health, pain relief, and nutrition.
