description: Following the spinoff of its contract logistics division (GXO) in 2021
    and freight brokerage operations (RXO) in 2022, XPO is moving closer to becoming
    a pure-play asset-based less-than-truckload carrier. We estimate LTL shipping
    makes up 60% of total revenue, with XPO's European truckload and LTL operations
    making up 40%. However, XPO's LTL segment EBITDA mix is much higher than 60%.
    We believe XPO intends to divest its European trucking division once it finds
    the right buyer.
