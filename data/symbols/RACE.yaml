description: Ferrari designs, engineers, and manufactures some of the world's most
    expensive luxury cars. With supply carefully controlled to be below demand and
    a brand steeped in decades of motor racing history, a Ferrari is viewed as a status
    symbol. In 2024, the company sold 13,752 vehicles at an average price over EUR
    480,000 with more than 70% of its vehicles being sold to existing Ferrari clients.
    Eighty-six percent of revenue is generated from the sale of cars and spare parts
    and 10% from sponsorship, commercial, and brand activities including racing and
    lifestyle activities. In 2024, the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region accounted
    for 47% of revenue, the Americas was 33%, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan
    was 8%, and the rest of Asia was 12%.
