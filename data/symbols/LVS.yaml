description: Las Vegas Sands is the world's largest operator of fully integrated resorts,
    featuring casino, hotel, entertainment, food and beverage, retail, and convention
    center operations. The company owns the Venetian Macao, Sands Macao, Londoner
    Macao, Four Seasons Hotel Macao, and Parisian Macao, as well as the Marina Bay
    Sands resort in Singapore. We expect Sands to open a fourth tower in Singapore
    in 2031. Its Venetian and Palazzo Las Vegas assets in the US were sold to Apollo
    and Vici in 2022. After the sale of its Vegas assets, the company generates all
    its EBITDA from Asia, with its casino operations generating the majority of sales.
