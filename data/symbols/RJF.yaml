description: Raymond James Financial is a diversified financial services firm that
    provides wealth management, investment banking, asset management, and capital
    markets services to individuals, corporations, and municipalities. The firm maintains
    an extensive catalogue of products and services across its business lines. However,
    the wealth management franchise generates the bulk of its revenues and earnings
    through a vast network of nearly 8,800 independent and employee-affiliated advisors,
    who collectively manage over $1.5 trillion in client assets as of fiscal year-end
    2024. While Raymond James maintains a global footprint, the company derives over
    90% of its revenue, and an even larger percentage of its operating income, from
    the United States.
