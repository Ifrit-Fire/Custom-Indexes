description: Roper Technologies is a holding company focused on acquiring, managing,
    and developing niche market-leading technology businesses. The company operates
    a decentralized business model whereby each portfolio company operates independently
    from the others. Roper positions itself as a free cash flow compounder, whereby
    excess free cash flow generated by its portfolio businesses is repatriated to
    the parent company, which is then utilized to acquire additional businesses. Presently,
    the company operates 30 distinct businesses with over three-fourths of the revenue
    coming from software products and over two-thirds of revenue coming from recurring
    and reoccurring sources.
