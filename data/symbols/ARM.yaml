description: Arm Holdings is the IP owner and developer of the ARM architecture, which
    is used in 99% of the world's smartphone CPU cores, and it also has high market
    share in other battery-powered devices like wearables, tablets, or sensors. Arm
    licenses its architecture for a fee, offering different types of licenses depending
    on the flexibility the customer needs. Customers like Apple or Qualcomm buy architectural
    licenses, which allow them to modify the architecture and add or delete instructions
    to tailor the chips to their specific needs. Other clients directly buy off-the-shelf
    designs from Arm. Both off-the-shelf and architectural customers pay a royalty
    fee per chip shipped.
