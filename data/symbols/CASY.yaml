description: Casey's General Stores Inc serves as convenience store chain with its
    2,900 locations, positioned in the Midwest United States. About half of Casey's
    stores are located in rural towns with populations under 5,000. While fueling
    stations serve as a key traffic driver, about two-thirds of the company's gross
    profit stems from in-store sales of grocery items, prepared meals, and general
    merchandise. Casey's owns more than 90% of its stores and operates the majority
    of its warehousing and distribution processes internally.
