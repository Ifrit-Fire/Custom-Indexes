description: Kenvue is the world's largest pure-play consumer health company by sales,
    generating over $15 billion in annual revenue. Formerly known as Johnson & Johnson's
    consumer segment, Kenvue spun off and went public in May 2023. It operates in
    a variety of silos within consumer health, such as cough, cold and allergy care,
    pain management, face and body care, and oral care, as well as women's health.
    Its portfolio has some of the most well-known brands in the space, including Tylenol,
    Listerine, Johnson's, Aveeno, and Neutrogena. Despite playing in a fragmented
    industry with intense competition and changing consumer preferences, many of Kenvue's
    brands are the global leader in their respective segment thanks to their strong
    brand power.
