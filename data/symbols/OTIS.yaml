description: Otis is the largest global elevator and escalator supplier by revenue
    with around 18% global market share. In 1854 Otis' founder and namesake Elisha
    Graves Otis, invented a safety mechanism that prevented elevators from falling
    if the hoisting cable failed. The company's product and service lifecycle begins
    with installations of elevator units in new buildings, later selling maintenance
    services on the units, and eventually replacement of the units after the average
    15- to 20-year useful life of an elevator. As the largest global OEM, Otis has
    amassed an installed base under service that exceeds 2 million elevators. Its
    business model is similar to that of its closest competitors Kone, Schindler,
    and TK Elevator.
