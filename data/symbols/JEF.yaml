description: Jefferies is a full-service investment banking and capital markets firm
    that was founded in 1962. After nearly 30 years of focusing on institutional trading
    services, it entered the investment banking industry in the early 1990s, which
    ultimately grew into the core business. In 2013, Jefferies merged with Leucadia,
    a manufacturing-focused holding company. Since merging, Jefferies became the bedrock
    of the business as the bulk of the legacy portfolio was sold off and the parent
    company was renamed to match the subsidiary. Within the investment banking landscape,
    Jefferies predominately serves the North American middle market and has captured
    considerable market share over the past decade.
