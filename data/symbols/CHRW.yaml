description: C.H. Robinson is a top-tier non-asset-based third-party logistics provider
    with a significant focus on domestic freight brokerage (about 60% of net revenue),
    which reflects mostly truck brokerage but also rail intermodal. Additionally,
    the firm operates a large air and ocean forwarding division (30%), which has grown
    organically and via tuck-in acquisitions over the years. The remainder of revenue
    consists of transportation management services and a legacy produce-sourcing operation.
