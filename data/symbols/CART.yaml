description: Maplebear (Instacart) operates a leading grocery delivery platform in
    the United States and Canada. The company partners with various regional and national
    grocers, which offer their selection of food and other goods to customers through
    Instacart's ubiquitous platform. Once an item is ordered through Instacart's site,
    the item is picked and delivered to the customer's home by one of the platform's
    600,000 shoppers, who are classified as independent contractors. Instacart earns
    fees based on average order value and leverages its platform's high usage to sell
    advertising, mainly to consumer-packaged goods companies. Instacart currently
    has about 8 million monthly active users (or orderers) on its platform.
