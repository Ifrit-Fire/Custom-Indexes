description: Crown Castle owns and leases roughly 40,000 cell towers in the United
    States. It also owns more than 90,000 route miles of fiber. It leases space on
    its towers to wireless service providers, which install equipment on the towers
    to support their wireless networks. Crown Castle's towers and fiber are predominantly
    in the largest US cities. The company has a very concentrated customer base, with
    about 75% of its revenue from the Big Three US mobile carriers. Crown Castle operates
    as a real estate investment trust. It has announced plans to divest its fiber
    business, which should be finalized in 2026. After that, Crown will be a stand-alone
    tower operator.
