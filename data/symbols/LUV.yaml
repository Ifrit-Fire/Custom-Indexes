description: Southwest Airlines is the largest domestic air carrier in the United
    States by passengers boarded. Southwest operates nearly 800 aircraft in an all-Boeing
    737 fleet. Despite offering some longer routes and a few perks for business travelers,
    the airline predominantly specializes in short-haul, leisure flights operated
    in a single, open-seating cabin configuration in a point-to-point network. In
    late 2025, Southwest will modify its cabins to offer some rows with extra legroom
    and will update its ticketing process and merchandising to offer assigned seats
    and more fare categories, including a basic economy class that will more directly
    compete with other airlines' offerings and appear for the first time in travel
    aggregators' search results.
