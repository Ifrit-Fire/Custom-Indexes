    major segments: consumer banking, global wealth and investment management, global
    banking, and global markets. Bank of America''s consumer-facing lines of business
    include its network of branches and deposit-gathering operations, retail lending

    Merrill Lynch operations provide brokerage and wealth-management services, as
    does its private bank. Wholesale lines of business include investment banking,
