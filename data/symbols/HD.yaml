description: Home Depot is the world's largest home improvement specialty retailer,
    operating 2,350 warehouse-format stores offering more than 30,000 products in
    store and 1 million products online in the US, Canada, and Mexico. Its stores
    offer building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products,
    and decor products and provide various services, including home improvement installation
    services and tool and equipment rentals. The acquisition of Interline Brands in
    2015 allowed Home Depot to enter the MRO business, which has been expanded through
    the tie-up with HD Supply (2020). The additions of the Company Store brought textiles
    to the lineup, and the 2024 tie-up with SRS will help grow professional demand
    in roofing, pool and landscaping projects.
