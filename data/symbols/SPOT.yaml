description: Spotify is the leading global music streaming service provider, with
    nearly 700 million monthly active users and over 250 million paying subscribers,
    with the latter constituting the firm's premium segment. Most of the firm's revenue
    and nearly all its gross profit come from the subscribers, who pay a monthly fee
    to access a music library that consists of most of the most popular songs ever
    recorded, including all from the major record labels. The firm also sells separate
    audiobook subscriptions and integrates podcasts within its standard music app.
    Podcast content is not exclusive and is typically free to access on other platforms.
    Ad-supported users can access a similar music catalog but cannot customize a similar
    on-demand experience.
