    streams, which is actively managed to generate the bulk of its revenue from gold,
    silver, and platinum. The company does not operate mines, develop projects, or
    conduct exploration. Franco-Nevada's short-term financial performance is linked
    to the price of commodities and the amount of production from its portfolio of
    producing assets. Its long-term performance is affected by the availability of
