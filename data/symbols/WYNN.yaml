description: 'Wynn Resorts operates luxury casinos and resorts. The company was founded
    in 2002 by Steve Wynn, the former CEO. The company operates four megaresorts:
    Wynn Macau and Encore in Macao and Wynn Las Vegas and Encore in Las Vegas. Cotai
    Palace opened in August 2016 in Macao, and Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts
    opened June 2019. We expect the company to continue to build nongaming attractions
    in Macao over the next few years. We model Wynn''s managed integrated resort in
    the United Arab Emirates to open in 2027. The company also operates Wynn Interactive,
    a digital sports betting and iGaming platform. The company received 76% and 24%
    of its 2019 prepandemic EBITDA from Macao and the US, respectively. In 2024, both
    the US and Macao were each 50% of total EBITDA.'
