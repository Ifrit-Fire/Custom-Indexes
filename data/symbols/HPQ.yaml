description: HP (formerly Hewlett-Packard) is a behemoth in the PC and printing markets.
    It has focused on these markets since it exited IT infrastructure in 2015 with
    the split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. HP focuses on the commercial market,
    but maintains sales of consumer devices and printers. The firm has a broad and
    global customer base, with only one third of sales coming from the US. HP completely
    outsources manufacturing and relies heavily on channel partners for its sales
    and marketing.
