description: 'Snap-on manufactures premium tools and software for repair professionals.
    Hand tools are sold through a franchisee-operated mobile van network that serve
    auto technicians who purchase tools at their own expense. A unique element of
    its business model is that franchisees bear significant risk, as they must invest
    in the mobile van, inventory, and software. At the same time, franchisees extend
    personal credit directly to technicians on an individual tool basis. Snap-on currently
    operates three segments: repair systems and information, commercial and industrial,
    and tools. Its finance arm provides financing to franchisees to run their operations,
    which includes offering loans and leases for mobile vans.'
