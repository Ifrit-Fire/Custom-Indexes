description: Vertiv has roots tracing back to 1946 when its founder, Ralph Liebert,
    developed an air-cooling system for mainframe data rooms. As computers started
    making their way into commercial applications in 1965, Liebert developed one of
    the first computer room air conditioning, or CRAC, units, enabling the precise
    control of temperature and humidity. The firm has slowly expanded its data center
    portfolio through internal product development and the acquisition of thermal
    and power management products like condensers, busways, and switches. Vertiv has
    global operations today; its products can be found in data centers in most regions
    throughout the world.
