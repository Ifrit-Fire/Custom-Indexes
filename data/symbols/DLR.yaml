description: Digital Realty owns and operates over 300 data centers worldwide. It
    has nearly 40 million rentable square feet across five continents. Digital's offerings
    range from retail co-location, where an enterprise may rent a single cabinet and
    rely on Digital to provide all the accommodations, to "cold shells," where hyperscale
    cloud service providers can simply rent much, or all, of a barren, power-connected
    building. In recent years, Digital Realty has de-emphasized cold shells and now
    primarily provides higher-level service to tenants, which outsource their related
    IT needs to Digital. The company operates as a real estate investment trust.
