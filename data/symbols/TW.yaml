description: Founded in 1998 and headquartered in New York City, Tradeweb Markets
    is a leading fixed-income trading platform. While it does offer electronic processing
    for some voice-negotiated trades, the company focuses primarily on providing electronic
    trading networks that connect broker/dealers, institutional clients, and retail
    customers. While the company offers trading in a wide variety of products, the
    bulk of its business is in U.S. and European government debt, mortgage-backed
    securities, interest-rate swaps, and U.S. and international corporate bonds. The
    firm also sells fixed-income trading and price data, primarily through a deal
    with Refinitiv's Eikon service.
