description: Rio Tinto is a global diversified miner. Iron ore is the dominant commodity,
    with significantly lesser contributions from copper, aluminum, diamonds, gold,
    and industrial minerals. The 1995 merger of RTZ and CRA, via a dual-listed structure,
    created the present-day company. The two operate as a single business entity,
    with shareholders in each company having equivalent economic and voting rights.
    Major assets included the Pilbara iron ore operations, a 30% stake in the Escondida
    copper mine, 66%-ownership of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia, the Weipa
    and Gove bauxite mines in Australia, and six hydro-powered aluminum smelters in
    Canada.
