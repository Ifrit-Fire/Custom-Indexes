description: Monster Beverage is a leader in the energy drink category within the
    nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage market, generating two thirds of revenue
    in the US and Canada. The well-known Monster trademark includes brands such as
    Monster Energy, Monster Ultra, Java Monster, and Juice Monster. The firm also
    owns other energy drink brands, such as Reign, NOS, Burn, Bang and Mother, and
    brews and distributes beers and flavored malt beverages following the acquisition
    of a craft brewer in 2022. Monster controls branding and innovation but outsources
    beverage manufacturing and packaging to copackers and finished goods distribution
    to bottlers in the global Coca-Cola system (pursuant to a 20-year agreement inked
    in 2015). Coke is the largest shareholder of Monster with a 19.5% stake.
