description: 'Founded in the late 1990s as an internet portal, NetEase has transformed
    into a leading force in the second-largest online game company gaming in China.
    While its initial success was built upon the massively multiplayer online role-playing
    game Fantasy Westward Journey, NetEase has expanded its portfolio with captivating
    franchises that resonate with both domestic and international players. Over the
    past decade, the company has created titles such as Justice, Identity V, Naraka:
    Bladepoint, and Eggy Party, all of which maintain significant player bases today.
    Beyond in-house development, the company also collaborates with likes of Microsoft
    and Marvel to create and publish games based on renowned IPs, including World
    of Warcraft, Diablo Immortal, and Marvel Rivals.'
