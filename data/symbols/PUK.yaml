description: Originally established as Prudential Mutual Assurance, Investment, and
    Loan Association in 1848, Prudential plc has moved on a lot since then. Set up
    to sell life insurance and loans to the middle and then the industrializing and
    urbanizing working classes, the company subsequently diversified into Europe and
    then North America with the purchase of Jackson National Life in around 1985.
    During its time as owner of Jackson, Prudential focused on building out a simple
    chassis-style product portfolio where customers could choose a variety of add-ons.
    The company also became renowned for its focus on building requisite internal
    capabilities to support its strong product offerings, including compelling technology
    and a large and well-trained wholesale sales.
