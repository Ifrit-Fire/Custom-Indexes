description: Alphabet is a holding company that wholly owns internet giant Google.
    The California-based company derives slightly less than 90% of its revenue from
    Google services, the vast majority of which is advertising sales. Alongside online
    ads, Google services houses sales stemming from Google's subscription services
    (YouTube TV, YouTube Music among others), platforms (sales and in-app purchases
    on Play Store), and devices (Chromebooks, Pixel smartphones, and smart home products
    such as Chromecast). Google's cloud computing platform, or GCP, accounts for roughly
    10% of Alphabet's revenue with the firm's investments in up-and-coming technologies
    such as self-driving cars (Waymo), health (Verily), and internet access (Google
    Fiber) making up the rest.
