description: Parker Hannifin started out in 1917 as Parker Appliance, selling pneumatic
    brakes. Through the acquisition of branded components, the firm has expanded into
    aerospace engines, agricultural and construction machinery, freight and passenger
    vehicles, and industrial automation equipment. Within these larger systems, Parker
    sells a wide array of small, critical pieces such as hydraulic, electromechanical,
    climate control, and filtration components. Many of its products are designed
    to work together, resulting in a high rate of cross-selling.
