description: Bentley Systems is a software vendor that caters to engineers, architects,
    constructors, and geospatial professionals by enabling design, modeling, simulation,
    project management, and data management of infrastructure assets. The firm delivers
    solutions via the cloud, desktop, and hybrid environments. While Bentley is relatively
    small in comparison with peers like Autodesk, it shines in core specialty areas,
    like bridge or rail design, as opposed to being more broad-based in its applications.
    Bentley's largest end market is the public works and utilities sector, which represents
    approximately two thirds of revenue.
