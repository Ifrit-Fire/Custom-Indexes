description: Kroger is one of the largest grocery retailers in the United States with
    about 2,700 stores across a portfolio of over 20 supermarket banners. The company
    boasts an ingrained presence in US communities, citing that it is a top-two grocer
    in most of its major market areas. Over one fourth of Kroger's roughly $110 billion
    in nonperishable and fresh food sales (about 75% of revenue) stems from its private-label
    portfolio, of which the company manufactures about 30% of units via its own food
    production plants. The company also operates fuel stations and pharmacies at 60%
    and 80% of its locations, respectively.
