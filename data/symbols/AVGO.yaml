    some manufacturing in-house, like for its best-of-breed FBAR filters that sell
    into the Apple iPhone. In software, it sells virtualization, infrastructure, and
    security software to large enterprises, financial institutions, and governments.Broadcom
    is the product of consolidation. Its businesses are an amalgamation of former
