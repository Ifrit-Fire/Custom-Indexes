description: In July 2015, Kraft merged with Heinz to create one of North America's
    largest food and beverage manufacturers. Beyond its namesake brands, its portfolio
    has since included Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, and Philadelphia. While the retail channel
    drives around 85% of its total sales, the firm also maintains a growing foodservice
    presence. Outside North America, Kraft Heinz's global reach includes a distribution
    network in Europe and emerging markets that drives nearly 25% of its consolidated
    sales base, as its products are sold in more than 190 countries and territories.
