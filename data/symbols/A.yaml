description: 'Originally spun out of Hewlett-Packard in 1999, Agilent has evolved
    into a leading life science and diagnostic firm. Today, Agilent''s measurement
    technologies serve a broad base of customers with its three operating segments:
    life science and applied tools, cross lab consisting of consumables and services
    related to life science and applied tools, and diagnostics and genomics. Over
    half of its sales are generated from the biopharmaceutical, chemical, and advanced
    materials end markets, which we view as the stickiest end markets, but it also
    supports clinical lab, environmental, forensics, food, academic, and government-related
    organizations. The company is geographically diverse, with operations in the US
    and China representing the largest country concentrations.'
