description: Pilgrim's Pride is the second-largest poultry producer in the US (59%
    of 2024 sales), the UK (29% including other European sales), and Mexico (12%).
    Its UK and European arm also includes pork operations from the 2019 acquisition
    of Tulip. Pilgrim's sells to chain restaurants, food processors, food distributors,
    and retail chains. Most of its US and Mexican sales come from fresh chicken, while
    prepared chicken and pork constitute most of its UK and European sales. JBS owns
    more than 80% of Pilgrim's Pride's outstanding shares, though it failed to acquire
    the remaining stake in 2021 after a special board committee deemed that JBS' offer
    undervalued Pilgrim's Pride.
