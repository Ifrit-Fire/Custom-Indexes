description: 'Hasbro is a branded play company providing children and families around
    the world with entertainment offerings based on a world-class brand portfolio.
    From toys and games to television programming, motion pictures, and a licensing
    program, Hasbro reaches customers by leveraging its well-known brands such as
    Transformers, Nerf, and Magic: The Gathering. The firm acquired EOne in 2019,
    bolting on popular family properties like Peppa Pig and PJ Masks, and since has
    divested noncore lines from the tie-up. Furthermore, the addition of Dungeons
    & Dragons Beyond in 2022, offers the firm access to 19 million digital tabletop
    players.'
