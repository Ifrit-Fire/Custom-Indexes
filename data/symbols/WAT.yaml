description: Water sells liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and thermal analysis
    tools. These analytical instruments provide essential information on various products,
    such as their molecular structures and physical properties, to help clients enhance
    the health and well-being of end users. As a percentage of sales in 2024, Waters
    generated 58% from biopharmaceutical customers, 31% from industrial clients, and
    11% from academic/government institutions. In early 2026, Waters plans to merge
    with BD's life science and diagnostics business, which will substantially change
    those concentrations. Waters will wind up with more concentration in diagnostics
    (versus none now) and discovery-related life science tools.
