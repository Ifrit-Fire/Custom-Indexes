description: Cigna primarily provides pharmacy benefit management and health insurance
    services. Its PBM and specialty pharmacy services, which were greatly expanded
    by its 2018 merger with Express Scripts, are mostly sold to health insurance plans
    and employers. Its largest PBM contract is with the Department of Defense (current
    contract through 2029), and it recently won a multiyear deal with top-tier insurer
    Centene. In health insurance and other benefits, Cigna primarily serves employers
    through self-funding arrangements, and the company operates mostly in the US with
    17 million US and 2 million international medical members covered as of December
    2024.
