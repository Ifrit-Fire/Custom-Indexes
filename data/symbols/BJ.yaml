description: BJ's Wholesale serves as one of the few warehouse club chains in the
    United States. Its 250 warehouses are primarily located along the East Coast,
    most prominently in the New England area. Similar to its warehouse club peers,
    BJ's charges annual membership fees and keeps costs down by operating a "no-frills"
    store environment. The company limits the use of distribution centers where possible
    and stores inventory on pallets directly on the sales floor, often in bulk quantities.
    The company also offers a limited assortment of 7,000 stock-keeping units at its
    warehouses to achieve greater procurement scale on select items. About 80% of
    BJ's net sales come from grocery items and general merchandise, with the remaining
    20% stemming from gasoline and other ancillary services.
