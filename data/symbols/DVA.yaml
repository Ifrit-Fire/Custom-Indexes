description: DaVita is the largest provider of dialysis services in the United States,
    boasting market share of about 35% when measured by clinics. The firm operates
    over 3,000 facilities worldwide, mostly in the US, and treats about 280,000 patients
    globally each year. Government payers dominate US dialysis reimbursement. DaVita
    receives about two thirds of US sales at government (primarily Medicare) reimbursement
    rates, with the remainder coming from commercial insurers. While commercial insurers
    represent only about 10% of US patients treated, they represent nearly all of
    the profits generated by DaVita in the US dialysis business. Berkshire Hathaway
    owns about 45% of DaVita.
