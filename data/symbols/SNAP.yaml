description: Snap is a technology company best known for its marquis social media
    application. Snapchat, a visual messaging application that has amassed hundreds
    of millions of users. The app was initially only used to communicate with family
    and friends through photographs and short videos (known as "Snaps"). Users can
    now enjoy augmented reality, or AR, lenses, content from famous creators and celebrities,
    updates about local events, and more. Although the app offers a paid subscription
    option with premium features, advertising sales produce most of the app's revenue.
    The firm also sells wearable devices called AR Spectacles, which can capture photos
    and videos overlayed with AR lenses, but these make up a small portion of Snap's
    overall sales.
