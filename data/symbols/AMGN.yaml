    drugs include red blood cell boosters Epogen and Aranesp, immune system boosters
    Neupogen and Neulasta, and Enbrel and Otezla for inflammatory diseases. Amgen
    introduced its first cancer therapeutic, Vectibix, in 2006 and markets bone-strengthening
    drugs Prolia/Xgeva (approved 2010) and Evenity (2019). The acquisition of Onyx
    Pharmaceuticals bolstered the firm's therapeutic oncology portfolio with Kyprolis.

    (lung cancer), and Tezspire (asthma). The 2023 Horizon acquisition brought several

    a growing biosimilar portfolio.
