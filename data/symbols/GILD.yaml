description: Gilead Sciences develops and markets therapies to treat and prevent life-threatening
    infectious diseases, with the core of its portfolio focused on HIV and hepatitis
    B and C. Gilead's acquisition of Pharmasset brought rights to hepatitis C drug
    Sovaldi, which is also part of newer combination regimens that remain standards
    of care. Gilead is also growing its presence in the oncology market via acquisitions,
    led by CAR-T cell therapy Yescarta/Tecartus (from Kite) and breast and bladder
    cancer therapy Trodelvy (from Immunomedics).
