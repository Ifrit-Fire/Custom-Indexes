description: Cintas has roots tracing back to 1929, during which the Farmer family
    cleaned and re-sold dirty rags to manufacturing plants in Ohio. The firm has grown
    its business organically and through acquisitions, and today Cintas acts as a
    one-stop outsourcing partner for businesses. Cintas will design, manufacture,
    collect, and clean every employee uniform for a small weekly sum, taking on the
    upfront capital expense itself. In the same stop, Cintas can also replace soiled
    or depleted mats, mops, trash liners, towels, first aid, fire, and cleaning products.
    Businesses value an outsourcing partner like Cintas as it simplifies operations
    and leaves noncore tasks with high regulatory standards in the hands of professionals.
