description: Agnico Eagle is a gold miner with mines in Canada, Mexico, Finland, and
    Australia. Agnico operated just one mine, LaRonde, as recently as 2008 before
    bringing its other mines online in rapid succession in the following years. It
    merged with Kirkland Lake Gold in 2022, acquiring the Detour Lake and Macassa
    mines in Canada along with the high-grade, low-cost Fosterville mine in Australia.
    It sold around 3.4 million gold ounces in 2024 and had about 15 years of gold
    reserves at end 2024. Agnico Eagle is focused on increasing gold production in
    lower-risk jurisdictions and bought the remaining 50% of its Canadian Malartic
    mine along with the Wasamac project and other assets from Yamana Gold in 2023.
