description: Founded in 2013 and headquartered in San Francisco, DoorDash is an online
    delivery demand aggregator. Consumers can use its app to order food items on-demand
    for delivery or in-store from merchants. Through the acquisition of Wolt in 2022,
    the firm also provides this service in Europe and Asia. DoorDash creates a marketplace
    for merchants to establish a presence online, market their offerings, and meet
    demand through delivery. The firm provides similar service to nonrestaurant businesses,
    such as grocery, retail, and pet supplies. Dash is also rolling out nascent technology
    like drone delivery in an effort to continually innovate and provide the best
    possible service to supply-side and demand-side contingents of its marketplace.
