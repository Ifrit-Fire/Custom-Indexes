description: Despite its Spanish origins, BBVA generates only around a quarter of
    its profits in Spain. We expect that on a normalised basis, BBVA's market-leading
    Mexican bank should contribute half of its earnings, while its Turkish operation
    should account for another 15%. The balance of BBVA's earnings comes from smaller
    operations in South America. BBVA is overwhelmingly a retail and commercial bank,
    with corporate and investment banking forming a minor part of the overall business.
    BBVA also offers insurance and investment products through its banking networks.
