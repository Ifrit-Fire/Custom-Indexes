description: Markel's primary business is property and casualty insurance. The company
    focuses primarily on specialty lines, ranging from areas such as executive liability
    to commercial equine insurance. The acquisition of Alterra in 2013 added substantial
    reinsurance operations, which now account for a little over 10% of premiums. The
    company uses capital generated by its insurance operations to buy noninsurance
    operations in diverse areas, such as bakery equipment manufacturing and residential
    homebuilding.
