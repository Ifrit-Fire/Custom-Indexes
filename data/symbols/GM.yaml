description: 'General Motors Co. emerged from the bankruptcy of General Motors Corp.
    (old GM) in July 2009. GM has eight brands and operates under three segments:
    GM North America, GM International, and GM Financial. The United States now has
    four brands instead of eight under old GM. The company regained its US market
    share leadership in 2022, after losing it to Toyota due to the chip shortage in
    2021. 2024''s share was 17.0%. The Cruise autonomous vehicle arm, which GM now
    owns outright, previously operated driverless geofenced AV robotaxi services in
    San Francisco and other cities, but after a 2023 accident, GM decided that it
    will focus on personal AVs. GM Financial became the company''s captive finance
    arm in 2010 via the purchase of AmeriCredit.'
