description: Fastenal began as an industrial retailer, expanding its product portfolio
    from nuts and bolts to cutting tools, safety equipment, and janitorial supplies.
    It transitioned into a distributor by building out a dense network of branches
    close to its business customers. Once a customer becomes large enough, Fastenal
    installs vending machines and its own personnel on-site. Today, these on-site
    locations exceed Fastenal's branch count and remain the firm's main focus for
    expansion. Fastenal acts as a one-stop outsourcing partner for its industrial
    customers, offering value-added services along with a wide breadth of maintenance,
    repair, and operations supplies.
