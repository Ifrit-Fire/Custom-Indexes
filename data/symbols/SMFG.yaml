description: Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group is roughly tied with Mizuho Financial
    Group for the status of Japan's second-largest bank after Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
    Group. As of March 2024, its market share of domestic loans was 7.2%, compared
    with 8.0% for MUFG. It has a larger consumer finance business than the other two
    megabanks, owning 100% of the Promise business and SMBC Card. It also controls
    one of Japan's largest leasing companies and SMBC Aviation Capital, one of the
    top five aircraft lessors globally. In securities, its SMBC Nikko unit is Japan's
    third-largest retail broker, although SMFG has lagged somewhat in institutional
    securities business and asset management.
