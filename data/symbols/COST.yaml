description: Costco operates a membership-based, no-frills retail model predicated
    on offering a select product assortment in bulk quantities at bargain prices.
    The firm avoids maintaining costly product displays by keeping inventory on pallets
    and limits distribution expenses by storing its inventory at point of sale in
    the warehouse. Given its frugal cost structure, the firm is able to price its
    merchandise below that of competing retailers, driving high sales volume per warehouse
    and generating strong profits on thin margins. Costco operates over 600 warehouses
    in the United States and has over 60% share in the domestic warehouse club industry.
    Internationally, Costco operates about 280 warehouses, primarily in Canada, Mexico,
    Japan, and the UK.
