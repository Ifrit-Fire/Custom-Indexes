description: Fidelity National Information Services provides core processing and ancillary
    services to banks, but its business has expanded over time. By acquiring SunGard
    in 2015, the company now provides record-keeping and other services to investment
    firms. With the acquisition of Worldpay in 2019, FIS was providing payment processing
    services for merchants and holding leading positions in the United States and
    United Kingdom. But the company sold off a majority interest in Worldpay and now
    has only a minority stake.
