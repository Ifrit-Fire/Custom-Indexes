description: Intercontinental Exchange is a vertically integrated operator of financial
    exchanges and provides ancillary data products. Though the company is probably
    best known for its ownership of the New York Stock Exchange, which it acquired
    in 2013, ICE operates a large derivatives exchange, too. The company's largest
    commodity futures product is the ICE Brent crude futures contract. In addition
    to the exchanges business, which is about 54% of net revenue, Intercontinental
    Exchange has used a series of acquisitions to create its mortgage technology business
    (22% of net revenue) and fixed-income and data services segment (24% of net revenue).
