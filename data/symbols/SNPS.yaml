description: Synopsys is a provider of electronic design automation software and intellectual
    property products. EDA software automates and aids in the chip design process,
    enhancing design accuracy, productivity, and complexity in a full-flow end-to-end
    solution. Synopsys' comprehensive portfolio is benefiting from a convergence of
    semiconductor companies moving up the stack of technologies toward systems-like
    companies, and systems companies moving down-stack toward in-house chip design.
    The resulting expansion in EDA customers alongside secular digitalization of various
    end markets benefits EDA vendors like Synopsys.
