description: SailPoint Inc delivers solutions to enable comprehensive identity security
    for the enterprise. The company does this by unifying identity data across systems
    and identity types, including employee identities, non-employee identities, and
    machine identities. The SaaS and customer-hosted offerings of the company leverage
    intelligent analytics to give organizations critical visibility into which identities
    currently have access to which resources, which identities should have access
    to those resources, and how that access is being used. Its solutions enable organizations
    to establish, control, and automate policies that help them define and maintain
    a robust security posture and achieve regulatory compliance.
