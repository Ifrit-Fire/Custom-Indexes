description: Freeport-McMoRan owns stakes in 10 copper mines, led by its 49% ownership
    of the Grasberg copper and gold operations in Indonesia, 55% of the Cerro Verde
    mine in Peru, and 72% of Morenci in Arizona. It sold around 1.2 million metric
    tons of copper (its share) in 2024, making it the one of the world's largest copper
    miners by volume. It also sold about 900,000 ounces of gold, mostly from Grasberg,
    and 70 million pounds of molybdenum. It had about 25 years of copper reserves
    at the end of December 2024. We expect it to sell similar amounts of copper midcycle
    in 2029, though we expect gold volumes to decline to about 650,000 ounces then
    due to falling production at Grasberg.
