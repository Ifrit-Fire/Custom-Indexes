description: Founded in 1890 as the first manufacturer of electric fans in North America,
    Emerson Electric has become a leading industrial automation player through the
    acquisition of established brands. Emerson organizes its business into seven segments
    that sell a wide range of automation software, power tools, and automation hardware
    such as valves, gauges, and switches. In recent years, Emerson divested its climate
    technology and consumer businesses to become more of a pure-play industrial automation
    company. The automation of a factory is an enticing long-term proposition for
    manufacturers, helping reduce accident rates and raise uptime and productivity.
