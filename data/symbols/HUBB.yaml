description: Founded in 1888 by Harvey Hubbell, the eponymous company was the conduit
    through which the pull-chain lamp socket was originally sold. Hubbell has since
    grown into an electricity transmission and distribution behemoth, housing more
    than 75 brands that sell components found on power lines, electrical substations,
    and within commercial and industrial buildings. The company's primary operations
    are within the United States, where around 90% of revenue is derived.
