description: Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio
    of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's
    iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like
    Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive
    software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like
    streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs
    its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn
    and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales
    come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly
    through partnerships and distribution.
