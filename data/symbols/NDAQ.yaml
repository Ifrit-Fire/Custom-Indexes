description: Founded in 1971, Nasdaq is primarily known for its equity exchange, but
    in addition to its trading business (about 22.5% of sales), the company sells
    market and financial data to investors, offers Nasdaq-branded indexes, and lists
    companies through its capital access segment (42.5%). Nasdaq's newest segment,
    financial technology, was primarily constructed through the acquisitions of Verafin
    and Adenza and has expanded the company into capital management, financial crime,
    and regulatory compliance software (35%) as it seeks to become a diversified technology
    company.
