description: Zimmer Biomet designs, manufactures, and markets orthopedic reconstructive
    implants as well as supplies and surgical equipment for orthopedic surgery. With
    the acquisitions of Centerpulse in 2003 and Biomet in 2015, Zimmer holds the leading
    share of the reconstructive market in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Roughly
    two thirds of total revenue is derived from sales of large joints; another fourth
    comes from extremities, trauma, sports medicine, and related surgical products.
    The firm spun out its dental and spine businesses in 2022.
