description: Franklin Resources provides investment services for individual and institutional
    investors. At the end of June 2025, Franklin had $1.606 trillion in managed assets,
    composed primarily of equity (41%), fixed-income (28%), multi-asset/balanced (11%)
    funds, alternatives (16%) and money market funds (4%). Distribution tends to be
    weighted between retail investors (55% of AUM) and institutional accounts (42%),
    with high-net-worth clients accounting for the remainder. Franklin is one of the
    more global of the US-based asset managers we cover, with 30% of its assets under
    management invested in global/international strategies and just as much sourced
    from clients domiciled outside the United States.
