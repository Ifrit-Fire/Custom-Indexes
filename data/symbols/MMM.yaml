description: '3M, a multinational conglomerate founded in 1902, sells tens of thousands
    of products ranging from sponges to respirators. The firm is well known for its
    extensive research and development capabilities, and it is a pioneer in inventing
    new use cases for its proprietary technologies. 3M is organized across three business
    segments: safety and industrial (representing around 44% of revenue), transportation
    and electronics (36%), and consumer (20%). The firm recently spun off its healthcare
    business, now known as Solventum. Nearly half of 3M''s revenue comes from outside
    the Americas.'
