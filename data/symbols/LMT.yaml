description: Lockheed Martin is the world's largest defense contractor and has dominated
    the Western market for high-end fighter aircraft since it won the F-35 Joint Strike
    Fighter program in 2001. Aeronautics is Lockheed's largest segment, which derives
    upward of two-thirds of its revenue from the F-35. Lockheed's remaining segments
    are rotary and mission systems, mainly encompassing the Sikorsky helicopter business;
    missiles and fire control, which creates missiles and missile defense systems;
    and space systems, which produces satellites and receives equity income from the
    United Launch Alliance joint venture.
