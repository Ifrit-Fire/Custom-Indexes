description: America Movil is the largest telecom carrier in Latin America, serving
    about 300 million wireless customers across the region. It also provides fixed-line
    phone, internet access, and television services in most of the countries it serves.
    Mexico is the firm's largest market, providing about 35% of service revenue. Movil
    dominates the Mexican wireless market with about 60% customer share and also serves
    about half of fixed-line internet access customers in the country. Brazil, its
    second most important market, provides about 20% of service revenue. Movil sold
    its low-margin wireless resale business in the US to Verizon in 2021 and now owns
    a 1.4% stake in the US telecom giant. The firm also holds a 61% stake in Telekom
    Austria.
