description: ITT began its journey as International Telephone & Telegraph in 1920.
    Through decades of acquisitions in the mid-1900s, ITT went from manufacturing
    telephone switching equipment to operating hotels, car rentals, insurance agencies,
    and bread bakeries. In 1995, the firm split into three separate entities, one
    of which is the ITT in current operation. After a few more spinoffs in 2011, today
    ITT Inc. sells automotive, industrial, and aerospace products such as brake pads,
    seals, pumps, valves, connectors, and regulators. It has operations around the
    globe with notable exposures to North America, Europe, and Asia.
