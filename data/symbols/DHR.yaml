description: In 1984, Danaher's founders transformed a real estate organization into
    an industrial-focused manufacturing company. Then, through a series of mergers,
    acquisitions, and divestitures, Danaher now focuses primarily on manufacturing
    scientific instruments and consumables in the life sciences and diagnostic industries
    after the late 2023 divestiture of its environmental and applied solutions group,
    Veralto.
