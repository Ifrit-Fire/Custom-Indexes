description: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is the world's largest dedicated
    chip foundry, with mid-60s market share in 2024. TSMC was founded in 1987 as a
    joint venture of Philips, the government of Taiwan, and private investors. It
    went public in Taiwan in 1994 and as an ADR in the US in 1997. TSMC's scale and
    high-quality technology allow the firm to generate solid operating margins, even
    in the highly competitive foundry business. Furthermore, the shift to the fabless
    business model has created tailwinds for TSMC. The foundry leader has an illustrious
    customer base, including Apple, AMD, and Nvidia, that looks to apply cutting-edge
    process technologies to its semiconductor designs. TSMC employs more than 83,000
    people.
