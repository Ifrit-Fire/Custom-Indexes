description: Church & Dwight is the leading global producer of baking soda. Its portfolio
    extends beyond its legacy category to include laundry products, cat litter, oral
    care, deodorant, and nasal care, all sold under the Arm & Hammer brand. Its brands
    also include Batiste, OxiClean, Vitafusion, Hero, and TheraBreath, which together
    with Arm & Hammer constitute around 70% of its annual sales and profits. Most
    recently, the firm added Touchland and its hand sanitizer business to its fold.
    Even as it works to expand its product reach, Church & Dwight still derives around
    80% of its sales from its home market in the US.
