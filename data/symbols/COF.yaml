description: Capital One is a diversified financial services holding company headquartered
    in McLean, Virginia. Originally a spinoff of Signet Financial's credit card division
    in 1994, the company is now primarily involved in credit card lending, auto loans,
    and commercial lending. Following the acquisition of Discover in 2025, the firm
    also has a modest personal loan business, though credit card lending still provides
    the majority of the bank's revenue.
