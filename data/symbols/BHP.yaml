description: BHP is a global diversified miner mainly supplying iron ore and copper.
    The merger of BHP Limited and Billiton PLC created the present-day BHP Group.
    The dual-listed structure from the 2001 BHP and Billiton merger was collapsed
    in 2022. Major assets include Pilbara iron ore and Escondida copper. Onshore US
    oil and gas assets were sold in 2018 and the remaining Petroleum assets were spun
    off and merged with Woodside in 2022, with BHP vesting the Woodside shares it
    received to BHP shareholders. It purchased copper miner Oz Minerals in fiscal
    2023 and is entering the potash market through the development of its Jansen project
    in Canada. However, due to low nickel prices, BHP placed its nickel business on
    care and maintenance in 2024.
