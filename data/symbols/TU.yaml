description: Telus is one of the Big Three wireless service providers in Canada, with
    over 10 million mobile phone subscribers nationwide constituting about 30% of
    the total market. It is the incumbent local exchange carrier in the western Canadian
    provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, where it provides internet, television,
    and landline phone services. It also has a small wireline presence in eastern
    Quebec. Mostly because of recent acquisitions, more than 20% of Telus' sales now
    come from nontelecom businesses, most notably in the international business services,
    health, security, and agriculture industries. The firm has a 55% economic stake
    in Telus International.
