description: ASML is the leader in photolithography systems used in manufacturing
    semiconductors. Photolithography is the process in which a light source is used
    to expose circuit patterns from a photo mask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest
    technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase
    the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically
    representing a high portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips. ASML outsources
    the manufacturing of most of its parts, acting like an assembler. ASML's main
    clients are TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.
