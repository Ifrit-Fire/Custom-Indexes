description: 'Alcon is one of the leading visioncare companies in the world. Following
    nine years as a Novartis subsidiary, it was spun off as a public company in April
    2019. Alcon operates in two segments: visioncare and surgical. Visioncare comprises
    contact lenses, lenscare solutions, and a suite of ocular health products. With
    brands like Dailies, Total1, and Air Optix, Alcon controls about one fourth of
    the US contact lens market. Surgical comprises intraocular lenses, ophthalmic
    surgical equipment, and consumables used during surgeries. Its main products include
    Centurion, a phacoemulsification device used during cataract surgeries, and a
    portfolio of IOLs including PanOptix and Vivity. Alcon has one of the largest
    installed bases of eye surgical equipment in the world.'
