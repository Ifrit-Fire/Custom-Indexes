description: RB Global has evolved into a leading global marketplace that connects
    buyers and sellers of commercial assets and vehicles. It is the result of the
    2023 combination of Ritchie Bros. and IAA. Ritchie Bros.' roots were as an auctioneer
    facilitating transactions of commercial, construction, and transportation equipment
    (excavators, bulldozers, forklifts, and commercial trucks and trailers). However,
    it has evolved into an omnichannel marketplace. IAA has similar roots, though
    primarily focused on the salvage auction segment for consumer automobiles. The
    group provides ancillary services including title processing, transportation/towing,
    financing, data and appraisal, and so on. Its activities are international, though
    skewing approximately two-thirds to North America.
