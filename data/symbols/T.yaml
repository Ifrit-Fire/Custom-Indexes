description: The wireless business contributes nearly 70% of AT&T's revenue. The company
    is the third-largest US wireless carrier, connecting 73 million postpaid and 17
    million prepaid phone customers. Fixed-line enterprise services, which account
    for about 14% of revenue, include internet access, private networking, security,
    voice, and wholesale network capacity. Residential fixed-line services, about
    12% of revenue, primarily consist of broadband internet access, serving 14 million
    customers. AT&T also has a sizable presence in Mexico, with 24 million customers,
    but this business only accounts for 3% of revenue. The company recently sold its
    70% equity stake in satellite television provider DirecTV to its partner, private
    equity firm TPG.
