description: MGM Resorts is the largest resort operator on the Las Vegas Strip with
    37,000 guest rooms and suites, representing about one fourth of all units in the
    market. The company's Vegas properties include MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Park MGM,
    Luxor, New York-New York, and Bellagio. The Strip contributed approximately 59%
    of total EBITDAR in 2024. MGM also owns US regional assets, which represented
    a low 20s share of 2024 EBITDAR (MGM's Macao EBITDAR was 21% of the total in 2024).
    MGM's US sports and i-gaming operations are currently a high-single-digit percentage
    of its total revenue. The company also operates the 56%-owned MGM China casinos
    with a new property that opened on the Cotai Strip in early 2018. We estimate
    MGM will open a resort in Japan in 2030.
