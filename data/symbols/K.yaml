description: Following its split from the North American cereal business in October
    2023, Kellanova (previously the global snacking arm of Kellogg) has operated as
    a leading global manufacturer and marketer of salty snacks, snack bars, frozen
    breakfast fare, meat alternatives, and other packaged foods. Its offerings are
    manufactured in around 20 countries and marketed in over 180. Its product mix
    includes well-known brands such as Pringles, Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, Pop-Tarts,
    Eggo, Nutri-Grain, and Morningstar Farms. Sales beyond its home turf account for
    about nearly two thirds of Kellanova's consolidated sales base. Mars is slated
    to acquire the recently independent business in a nearly $36 billion deal in the
    first half of calendar 2025.
