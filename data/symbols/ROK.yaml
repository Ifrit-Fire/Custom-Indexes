    and control products such as programmable controllers, computers, and operator
    terminals. Its smallest segment, lifecycle services, offers digital consulting,
    engineered-to-order services, and other outsourced services such as remote monitoring,
    cybersecurity, and asset and plant maintenance and optimization.
