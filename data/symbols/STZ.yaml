description: Constellation Brands is the largest provider of alcoholic beverages across
    the beer, wine, and spirits categories in the US, generating 84% of revenue from
    Mexican beer imports under top-selling brands such as Modelo and Corona. The rest
    of the business includes some remaining wine and spirits brands, categories where
    the company continue to prune assets in recent years. With its exclusive rights
    tied to the Mexican beer brands effective only in the US, the firm has little
    revenue exposure to international markets. Constellation owns a 26% stake in no-moat
    Canopy Growth, a medicinal and recreational cannabis producer in Canada, and has
    a 50/50 joint venture with glass manufacturer Owens-Illinois in Mexico.
