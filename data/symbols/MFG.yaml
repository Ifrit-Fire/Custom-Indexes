description: Mizuho Financial Group is roughly tied with megabank peer Sumitomo Mitsui
    Financial Group for the status as Japan's second-largest bank after Mitsubishi
    UFJ Financial Group. As of March 2024, Mizuho's market share of domestic loans
    was 6.8%, compared with 7.2% for SMFG and 8.0% for MUFG. In Japan, Mizuho has
    more of a corporate focus than SMFG, which has a larger retail business. Its overseas
    weighting is slightly smaller than that of MUFG. Unlike its two Japanese megabank
    peers, which own foreign banks outright or hold noncontrolling stakes in local
    banks overseas, Mizuho expanded in recent years beyond its traditional Japanese
    borrowers, mainly through its core banking and securities units, focusing on the
    financing needs of global multinational corporations.
