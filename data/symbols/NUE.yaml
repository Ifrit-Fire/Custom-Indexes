description: Nucor Corp manufactures steel and steel products. The company's reportable
    segments are steel mills, steel products, and raw materials. A majority of its
    revenue is derived from the steel mills segment, which is engaged in producing
    sheet steel (hot-rolled, cold-rolled, and galvanized), plate steel, structural
    steel (wide-flange beams, beam blanks, H-piling, and sheet piling), and bar steel
    products. Nucor manufactures steel principally from scrap steel and scrap steel
    substitutes using electric arc furnaces (EAFs) along with continuous casting and
    automated rolling mills. The steel mills segment sells its products mainly to
    steel service centers, fabricators, and manufacturers located in the United States,
    Canada, and Mexico.
