description: Based in Toronto, Barrick Gold is one of the world's largest gold miners.
    In 2024, the firm produced nearly 3.9 million attributable ounces of gold and
    about 430 million pounds of copper. At year-end 2024, Barrick had about two decades
    of gold reserves along with significant copper reserves. After buying Randgold
    in 2019 and combining its Nevada mines in a joint venture with competitor Newmont
    later that year, it operates mines in 19 countries in the Americas, Africa, the
    Middle East, and Asia. The company also has growing copper exposure. Its potential
    Reko Diq project in Pakistan, if developed, could double copper production by
    the end of the decade.
