description: Tyson Foods is a protein-focused food producer, selling raw chicken,
    beef, pork, and prepared foods. Chicken and beef are its two largest segments,
    each composing about one third of US sales. Prepared foods constituted 18% of
    fiscal 2024 sales and include brands like Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball
    Park, and Sara Lee. However, most of these are in product categories rife with
    competition where Tyson does not have a massive market share lead. Tyson sells
    some products overseas, but the international segment accounts for just 4% of
    total revenue. The company is an active acquirer, with more recent years' purchases
    focused on international and food-service markets.
