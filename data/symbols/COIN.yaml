description: Founded in 2012, Coinbase is the leading cryptocurrency exchange platform
    in the United States. The company intends to be the safe and regulation-compliant
    point of entry for retail investors and institutions into the cryptocurrency economy.
    Users can establish an account directly with the firm, instead of using an intermediary,
    and many choose to allow Coinbase to act as a custodian for their cryptocurrency,
    giving the company breadth beyond that of a traditional financial exchange. While
    the company still generates the majority of its revenue from transaction fees
    charged to its retail customers, Coinbase uses internal investment and acquisitions
    to expand into adjacent businesses, such as prime brokerage and data analytics.
