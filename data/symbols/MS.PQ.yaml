description: Morgan Stanley is a massive global financial services firm, with offices
    in 42 countries and more than 80,000 employees as of year-end 2024. The firm cut
    its teeth in investment banking and institutional trading, where it maintains
    a strong presence today, but generates the lion share of its income from wealth
    and asset management franchises, where it boasted $7.9 trillion in client assets
    at the end of its most recent fiscal year. After reincorporation as a bank holding
    company in the wake of the great financial crisis, Morgan Stanley also boasts
    a top 10 banking franchise by deposits, with nearly $400 billion in customer deposits,
    predominately attributable to cash sweeps from its wealth management and brokerage
    businesses.
