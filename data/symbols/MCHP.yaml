description: Microchip Technology became an independent company in 1989 when it was
    spun off from General Instrument. More than half of revenue comes from MCUs, which
    are used in a wide array of electronic devices from remote controls to garage
    door openers to power windows in autos. The company's strength lies in lower-end
    8-bit MCUs that are suitable for a wider range of less technologically advanced
    devices, but the firm has expanded its presence in higher-end MCUs and analog
    chips as well.
