description: Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is the largest bank in Japan in terms
    of market capitalization and assets, with an 8.0% share of all domestic loans
    as of March 2024. It is the largest non-Chinese bank group globally and has a
    balance sheet slightly larger than those of JPMorgan Chase and HSBC Holdings.
    MUFG's operations in Japan account for around half of profit, banking in Thailand
    and Indonesia for around 15%, and equity-method earnings from Morgan Stanley most
    of the rest.
