description: Illumina provides tools and services to analyze genetic material with
    life science and clinical lab applications. The company generates over 90% of
    its revenue from sequencing instruments, consumables, and services. Illumina's
    high-throughput technology enables whole genome sequencing in humans and other
    large organisms. Its lower throughput tools enable applications that require smaller
    data outputs, such as viral and cancer tumor screening. Illumina also sells microarrays
    (9% of 2024 sales) that enable lower-cost, focused genetic screening with primarily
    consumer and agricultural applications.
