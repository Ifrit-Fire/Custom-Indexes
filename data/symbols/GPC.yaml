description: Genuine Parts sells aftermarket automotive parts (60% of sales) and industrial
    products (40% of sales) in the United States and internationally. The automotive
    segment primarily acts as a distributor to its network of 9,800 global retail
    locations, of which about two-thirds are independently owned and operated. We
    estimate Genuine serves around 6,000 retail locations in the US operating under
    the Napa Auto Parts brand, with about 80% of end-market sales derived from professional
    customers. Its industrial segment, primarily operating under the Motion name in
    the United States, is a leading distributor of bearings, power transmission, and
    other industrial products to more than 200,000 maintenance, repair, and original
    equipment manufacturer customers.
