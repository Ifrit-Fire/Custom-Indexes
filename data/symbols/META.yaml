description: Meta is the largest social media company in the world, boasting close
    to 4 billion monthly active users worldwide. The firm's "Family of Apps," its
    core business, consists of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. End users
    can leverage these applications for a variety of different purposes, from keeping
    in touch with friends to following celebrities and running digital businesses
    for free. Meta packages customer data, gleaned from its application ecosystem
    and sells ads to digital advertisers. While the firm has been investing heavily
    in its Reality Labs business, it remains a very small part of Meta's overall sales.
