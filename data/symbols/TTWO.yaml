description: Take-Two is one of the largest global developers and publishers of video
    games, with labels including Rockstar, 2K, and Zynga. Grand Theft Auto is the
    firm's biggest franchise, accounting for about 30% of total sales for the past
    decade. NBA 2K is the industry's dominant basketball video game, with Take-Two
    releasing a new version annually. Other notable franchises include Red Dead Redemption,
    Borderlands, and Civilization. Typically, more than three quarters of the firm's
    sales are from in-game spending, with the remainder coming from initial game sales.
    Since acquiring Zynga in 2022, mobile makes up about half of total sales.
