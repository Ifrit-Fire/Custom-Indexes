description: Celsius Holdings plays in the energy drink subsegment of the global nonalcoholic
    beverage market, with 95% of revenue concentrated in North America. Celsius' products
    contain natural ingredients and a metabolism-enhancing formulation, appealing
    to fitness and active lifestyle enthusiasts. The firm's portfolio includes its
    namesake Celsius Originals beverages, Celsius Essentials line (containing aminos),
    Celsius On-the-Go powder packets, and the recently acquired portfolio of Alani
    Nu energy drinks and snacks. Celsius dedicates its efforts to branding and innovation,
    while it largely utilizes third parties for the manufacturing, packaging, and
    distribution of its products. In 2022, Celsius forged a 20-year distribution agreement
    with PepsiCo, which holds an 8.5% stake in the business.
