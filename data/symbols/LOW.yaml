description: "Lowe's is the second-largest home improvement retailer in the world,\
    \ operating 1,750 stores in the United States, after the 2023 divestiture of its\
    \ Canadian locations (RONA, Lowe's Canada, R\xE9no-D\xE9p\xF4t, and Dick's Lumber).\
    \ The firm's stores offer products and services for home decorating, maintenance,\
    \ repair, and remodeling, with maintenance and repair accounting for two thirds\
    \ of products sold. Lowe's primarily targets retail do-it-yourself (around 70%\
    \ of sales) and do-it-for-me customers, but has expanded its commercial and professional\
    \ business clients to 30% from less than 20% in the past six years. We estimate\
    \ Lowe's captures a high-single-digit share of the domestic home improvement market,\
    \ based on US Census data and management's market size estimates."
