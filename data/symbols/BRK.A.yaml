description: 'Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company with a wide array of subsidiaries
    engaged in diverse activities. The firm''s core business segment is insurance,
    run primarily through Geico, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and Berkshire
    Hathaway Primary Group. Berkshire has used the excess cash thrown off from these
    and its other operations over the years to acquire Burlington Northern Santa Fe
    (railroad), Berkshire Hathaway Energy (utilities and energy distributors), and
    the companies that make up its manufacturing, service, and retailing operations
    (which include five of Berkshire''s largest noninsurance pretax earnings generators:
    Precision Castparts, Lubrizol, Clayton Homes, Marmon, and IMC/ISCAR). The conglomerate
    is unique in that it is run on a completely decentralized basis.'
