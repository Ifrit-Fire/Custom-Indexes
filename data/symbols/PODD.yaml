description: Insulet was founded in 2000 with the goal of making continuous subcutaneous
    insulin infusion therapy for diabetes easier to use. The result was the Omnipod
    system, which consists of a small disposable insulin infusion device that can
    be operated through a smartphone to control dosage. Since the Omnipod was approved
    by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2005, approximately 500,000 insulin-dependent
    diabetic patients are using it worldwide.
