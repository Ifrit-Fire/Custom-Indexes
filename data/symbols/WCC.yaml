description: Wesco can be traced back to the late 1800s but was officially founded
    in 1922, acting as the distribution arm of Westinghouse Electric. Throughout the
    1900s, Wesco entered and subsequently exited the consumer electronics, transit,
    bottling, and nuclear plant distribution markets. It was sold to a private equity
    firm in 1994 and then went public in 1999, and numerous acquisitions have since
    been made to fill the gaps in Wesco's geographical and product coverage. Today,
    the firm primarily distributes electrical, networking, security, and utility equipment
    used in the construction and repair of structures such as offices, data centers,
    power transmission lines, and manufacturing plants. Wesco has operations around
    the globe but generates the majority of its revenue in the United States.
