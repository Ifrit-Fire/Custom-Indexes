description: Over the past 150-plus years, Campbell's has evolved into a leading domestic
    packaged food manufacturer, with a portfolio that extends beyond its iconic red-and-white
    labeled canned soup. In fiscal 2024 (July year-end), snacks accounted for nearly
    half of its revenue, followed by soup (28%), other simple meals (17%), and beverages
    (7%). Outside its namesake, its brands include Pepperidge Farm, Goldfish, Snyder's
    of Hanover, Swanson, Pacific Foods, Prego, Pace, V8, and recently acquired Rao's
    (a deal that closed in March 2024). Around 90% of its revenue results from the
    US and the remainder from Canada and Latin America.
