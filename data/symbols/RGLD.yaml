description: Royal Gold Inc enquires and manages precious metal royalties and streams
    with a focus on gold. The company purchases a percentage of the metal produced
    from a mineral property for an initial payment without assuming responsibility
    for mining operations. Similarly, precious metal streams are purchase agreements
    with mine operators providing the right to purchase all or a portion of one or
    more metals produced from a mine in exchange for an upfront deposit payment. Generally,
    Royal Gold does not work on the properties in which it holds royalty and streaming
    assets. The company owns a portfolio of producing, development, evaluation, and
    exploration royalties and streams, and the majority of group revenue is generated
    from Canada, Mexico, Chile, and the United States.
