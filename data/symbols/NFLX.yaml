description: Netflix's relatively simple business model involves only one business,
    its streaming service. It has the biggest television entertainment subscriber
    base in both the United States and the collective international market, with more
    than 300 million subscribers globally. Netflix has exposure to nearly the entire
    global population outside of China. The firm has traditionally avoided a regular
    slate of live programming or sports content, instead focusing on on-demand access
    to episodic television, movies, and documentaries. The firm introduced ad-supported
    subscription plans in 2022, giving the firm exposure to the advertising market
    in addition to the subscription fees that have historically accounted for nearly
    all its revenue.
