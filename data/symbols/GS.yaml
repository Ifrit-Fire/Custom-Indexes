description: Goldman Sachs is a storied financial institution, founded in 1869 and
    best known for its role as a leading global investment bank. The firm has a sprawling
    reach across global financial centers and has been the leading provider of global
    merger and acquisition advisory services, by revenue, for the past 20 years. Since
    the global financial crisis, Goldman has expanded its offerings into more stable
    fee-based businesses like asset and wealth management, which comprised roughly
    30% of post-provision revenue at the end of 2024. The bank holding company generates
    revenue from investment banking, global market making and trading, lending, asset
    management, wealth management, and a small and declining portfolio of consumer
    credit card loans.
