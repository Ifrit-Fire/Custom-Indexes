description: BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with $12.528 trillion
    in assets under management at the end of June 2025. Its product mix is diverse,
    with 54% of managed assets in equity strategies, 25% in fixed income, 8% in multi-asset
    classes, 8% in money market funds, and 5% in alternatives. Passive strategies
    account for two-thirds of long-term AUM, with the company's ETF platform maintaining
    a leading market share domestically and on a global basis. Product distribution
    is weighted more toward institutional clients, which, by our calculations, account
    for around 80% of AUM. BlackRock is geographically diverse, with clients in more
    than 100 countries and more than one-third of managed assets coming from investors
    domiciled outside the US and Canada.
