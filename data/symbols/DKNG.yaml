description: DraftKings got its start in 2012 as an innovator in daily fantasy sports.
    Then, following a Supreme Court ruling in 2018 that allowed states to legalize
    online sports wagering, the company expanded into online sports and casino gambling,
    where it generally holds the number two or three revenue share position across
    states in which it competes. DraftKings is now live with online or retail sports
    betting in 28 states and iGaming in five states, with both products available
    to around 40% of Canada's population. In 2024, sports revenue was 61% of total
    sales, i-gaming 32%, and fantasy and lottery 7%. The company also operates a non-fungible
    token commissioned-based marketplace and develops and licenses online gaming products.
