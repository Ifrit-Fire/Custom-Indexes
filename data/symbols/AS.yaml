description: Amer Sports manages a diverse portfolio of 10 outdoor and action sports
    brands that collectively generated revenue of $5.2 billion in 2024. Although primarily
    owned by the Chinese conglomerate Anta Sports, Amer operates with a degree of
    autonomy. In its rapidly expanding China business, the company is subject to closer
    oversight, but it manages its operations outside of China with relative independence.
    In 2024, the firm generates 36% of its revenue from the Americas, 29% from Europe,
    the Middle East, and Africa, 25% from China, and 10% from Asia-Pacific, excluding
    China.
