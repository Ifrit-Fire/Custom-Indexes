description: Old Dominion Freight Line is the second-largest less-than-truckload carrier
    in the United States (following FedEx Freight), with more than 250 service centers
    and 11,000-plus tractors. It is one of the most disciplined and efficient providers
    in the trucking industry, and its profitability and capital returns are head and
    shoulders above its peers. Strategic initiatives revolve around boosting network
    density through market share gains and maintaining industry-leading service (including
    ultralow cargo claims) via steadfast infrastructure investment.
