description: Comcast is made up of three parts. The core cable business owns networks
    capable of providing television, internet access, and phone services to 64 million
    US homes and businesses, or nearly half of the country. The firm provides services
    to about half of the locations in this territory. Comcast acquired NBCUniversal
    from General Electric in 2011. NBCU owns several cable networks, including CNBC,
    MSNBC, and USA, the NBC network, the Peacock streaming platform, several local
    NBC affiliates, Universal Studios, and several theme parks. The firm plans to
    spin off most of its cable networks later in 2025. Finally, Sky, acquired in 2018,
    is a large television provider in the UK and Italy.
