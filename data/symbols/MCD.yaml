description: 'McDonald''s is the largest restaurant owner-operator in the world, with
    2024 system sales of $131 billion across more than 43,000 stores and 115 markets.
    McDonald''s pioneered the franchise model, building its footprint through partnerships
    with independent restaurant franchisees and master franchise partners around the
    globe. The firm earns roughly 60% of its revenue from franchise royalty fees and
    lease payments, with most of the remainder coming from company-operated stores
    across its three core segments: the United States, internationally operated markets,
    and international developmental/licensed markets.'
