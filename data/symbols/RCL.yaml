description: Royal Caribbean is the world's second-largest cruise company by revenues,
    operating 68 ships across five global and partner brands in the cruise vacation
    industry. Brands the company operates include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity
    Cruises, and Silversea. The company also has a 50% investment in a joint venture
    that operates TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises. The selection of brands in
    the portfolio allows Royal to compete on the basis of innovation, quality of ships
    and service, variety of itineraries, choice of destinations, and price. The company
    completed the divestiture of its Azamara brand in 2021 and plans to launch its
    new Celebrity River Cruise brand in 2027.
