description: 'Founded in 1911 by Joseph Eaton, the eponymous company began by selling
    truck axles in New Jersey. Eaton has since become an industrial powerhouse largely
    through acquisitions in various end markets. Eaton''s portfolio can broadly be
    divided into two parts: its electrical and industrial businesses. Its electrical
    portfolio (representing around 70% of company revenue) sells components within
    data centers, utilities, and commercial and residential buildings, while its industrial
    business (30% of revenue) sells components within commercial and passenger vehicles
    and aircraft. Eaton receives favorable tax treatment as a domiciliary of Ireland,
    but it generates over half of its revenue within the US.'
