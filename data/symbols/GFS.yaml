description: GlobalFoundries is a top-five contract semiconductor manufacturer globally.
    It was originally the manufacturing arm of Advanced Micro Devices before it was
    spun out in 2009. The foundry sells chips into a range of end markets including
    smartphones, PCs, Internet of Things, data centers, automotive, industrial, and
    so on, but primarily focuses on more mature process technologies. Until 2021,
    the firm was privately held by Mubadala Investment, the sovereign wealth fund
    of the United Arab Emirates, which remains its controlling shareholder today.
    GlobalFoundries merged with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing in 2009 and
    acquired IBM's chipmaking business in 2015. GF is headquartered in Malta, New
    York, and employs about 13,000 people.
