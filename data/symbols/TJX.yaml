description: TJX Companies is the leading off-price retailer of apparel, accessories,
    and home merchandise in the United States. The firm leverages its more than 20,000
    global vendor relationships to procure and sell brand-name merchandise at prices
    20%-60% cheaper than conventional retail channels. TJX opportunistically purchases
    excess inventory that stems from manufacturing overruns and retail closeout sales.
    The retailer disperses its vast and disparate merchandise across its 5,000 global
    stores, creating a treasure-hunt shopping experience for consumers. Over three
    quarters of TJX's sales are derived from the United States, primarily via the
    T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods banners. About 10% of sales come from Canada
    and 12% from Europe and Australia.
