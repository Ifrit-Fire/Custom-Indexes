description: Vale is a large global miner and the world's largest producer of iron
    ore and pellets. In recent years the company has sold noncore assets such as its
    fertilizer, coal, and steel operations to concentrate on iron ore, nickel, and
    copper. Earnings are dominated by the bulk materials division, primarily iron
    ore and iron ore pellets. The base metals division is much smaller, consisting
    of nickel mines and smelters along with copper mines producing copper in concentrate.
    In 2024, Vale sold a minority 10% stake in energy transition metals, its base
    metals business, likely the first step in separating base metals and iron ore.
