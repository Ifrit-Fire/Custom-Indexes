description: J.M. Smucker is a packaged food company that primarily sells through
    the US retail channel (73% of fiscal 2025 revenue came through its retail pet
    foods, coffee, and frozen handheld/spreads segments), with the remaining share
    consisting of sweet baked snacks (through the Hostess acquisition) and international
    (primarily Canada). Retail coffee is its largest category (32% of sales) with
    brands Folgers and Dunkin'. Pet foods (19% of sales) holds leading brands like
    Milk-Bone and Meow Mix. Of its remaining, approximately 22% comes from frozen
    handhelds and spreads, through brands Jif, Smucker's, and Uncrustables. The company
    acquired Hostess Brands in fiscal 2024 to boost its snack and convenience store
    presence.
