description: Hershey is a leading US confectionery manufacturer (around a $54 billion
    market, according to Euromonitor), controlling around 36% of the domestic chocolate
    space. Beyond its namesake label, the firm's mix has expanded over the last 85
    years and now consists of 100 brands, including Reese's, Kit Kat, Kisses, and
    Ice Breakers. Hershey's products are sold in about 80 countries, albeit with just
    a high-single-digit percentage of sales coming from markets outside the US, including
    Brazil, India, and Mexico. The firm has sought inorganic opportunities to extend
    its reach beyond its core confection business, adding Amplify Snack Brands and
    its Skinny Pop ready-to-eat popcorn to its mix, Pirate Brands, and Dot's Pretzels
    over the past few years.
