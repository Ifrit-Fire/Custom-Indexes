description: Vodafone operates mobile and fixed-line networks and businesses in more
    than 20 countries. Its largest market is Germany, where it is the second mobile
    operator after Deutsche Telekom and owns a cable network after acquiring Kabel
    Deutschland in 2013 and Liberty Global Germany in 2019. In the UK it acts as a
    mobile operator and is attempting a merger with CK Hutchison. In 2024 Vodafone
    divested its Spanish and Italian divisions, given their low returns on invested
    capital.
