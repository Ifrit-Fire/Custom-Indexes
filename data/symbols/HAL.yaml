description: Halliburton is North America's largest oilfield service company as measured
    by market share. Despite industry fragmentation, it holds a leading position in
    the hydraulic fracturing and completions market, which makes up nearly half of
    its revenue. It also holds strong positions in other service offerings like drilling
    and completions fluids, which leverages its expertise in material science, as
    well as the directional drilling market. While we consider SLB the global leader
    in reservoir evaluation, we think Halliburton leads in any activity from the reservoir
    to the wellbore. The firm's innovations have helped multiple producers lower their
    development costs per barrel of oil equivalent, with techniques that have been
    homed in over a century of operations.
