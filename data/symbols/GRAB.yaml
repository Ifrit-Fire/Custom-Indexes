description: Founded in 2012, Grab provides ride-sharing services, food and grocery
    delivery, and financial services (payments, consumer loans, and enterprise offerings)
    in eight Southeast-Asian countries through its mobile platform. The company partners
    with merchants and riders, connecting them with consumers while charging commission
    to both sides. Grab has a leading market share in and derives 89% of its revenue
    from its core businesses, ride-sharing and food delivery. Singapore, Indonesia,
    and Malaysia contributed more than 70% of revenue in 2024. Grab's main competitors
    in Southeast Asia are Line Man and Goto. Its financial services business is still
    in its nascent stage and provides minimal revenue currently. The company now also
    generates advertising revenue.
