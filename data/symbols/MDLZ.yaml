description: Mondelez has operated independently since its split from the former Kraft
    Foods North American grocery business in October 2012. The firm is a leading player
    in the global snack enclave with a presence in the biscuit (49% of sales as of
    the end of fiscal 2024), chocolate (31%), gum/candy (11%), beverage (3%), and
    cheese and grocery (6%) aisles. Mondelez's portfolio includes well-known brands
    like Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Halls, and Cadbury. The firm derives around one-third of
    its revenue from developing markets, just more than one-third from Europe, and
    the remainder from North America.
