description: Based in Chicago, CME Group operates exchanges giving investors, suppliers,
    and businesses the ability to trade futures and derivatives based on interest
    rates, equity indexes, foreign currencies, energy, metals, and commodities. The
    Chicago Mercantile Exchange was founded in 1898 and in 2002 completed its IPO.
    Since then, CME Group has consolidated parts of the industry by merging with crosstown
    rival CBOT Holdings in 2007 before acquiring Nymex Holdings in 2008 and NEX in
    2018. In addition, the company has a 27% stake in S&P Dow Jones Indices, making
    the Chicago Mercantile Exchange the exclusive venue to trade and clear S&P futures
    contracts. Through CME's acquisition of NEX, it also expanded into cash foreign
    exchange, fixed-income trading, and collateral optimization.
