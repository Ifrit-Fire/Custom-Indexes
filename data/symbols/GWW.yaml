description: Founded in 1927, W.W. Grainger originally distributed various motors
    via a mail-order catalogue. Over the course of the 20th century, the firm expanded
    into new industrial product categories and launched its first digital catalogue
    in 1995. Today, the company organizes itself into two segments focused on different
    customer bases. Its larger segment, high-touch solutions, offers a vast array
    of maintenance, repair, and operations, or MRO, supplies and bespoke inventory
    management services to larger businesses. Its smaller segment, endless assortment,
    operates two online platforms, Zoro and MonotaRO, that offer comprehensive catalogues
    of MRO supplies to smaller businesses. Grainger has operations throughout the
    world but primarily generates sales within the US.
