description: Chipotle Mexican Grill is the largest fast-casual chain restaurant in
    the United States, with systemwide sales of $11.3 billion in 2024. The Mexican
    concept is almost exclusively company-owned, with just three license stores operated
    through a master franchise relationship with Alshaya Group in the Middle East.
    It had a footprint of 3,726 stores at the end of 2024, heavily indexed to the
    United States, although it maintains a small presence in Canada, the UK, France,
    and Germany. Chipotle sells burritos, burrito bowls, tacos, quesadillas, and beverages,
    with a selling proposition built around competitive prices, high-quality food
    sourcing, speed of service, and convenience. The company generates its revenue
    entirely from restaurant sales and delivery fees.
