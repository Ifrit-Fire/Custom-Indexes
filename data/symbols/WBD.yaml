description: 'Warner Bros. Discovery was formed in 2022 through the combination of
    WarnerMedia and Discovery Communications. It operates in three global business
    segments: studios, networks, and direct-to-consumer. Warner Bros. Pictures is
    the crown jewel of the studios business, producing, distributing, and licensing
    movies and television shows. The networks business consists of basic cable networks,
    such as CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery, HGTV, and the Food Network. Direct-to-consumer
    includes HBO and the firm''s streaming platforms, which have now been consolidated
    to Max and Discovery+. Much of the DTC content is created within the firm''s other
    two business segments. Each segment operates with a global reach, with Max available
    in over 70 countries.'
