    player in the household and personal care arena. In addition to its namesake oral
    care line (which accounts for north of 40% of its total sales), the firm manufactures
    shampoos, shower gels, deodorants, and homecare products that are sold in over
    200 countries. International sales account for about 70% of its total business,
    including approximately 45% from emerging regions. It also owns specialty pet
    food maker Hill's (around one fifth of sales), which sells a majority of its products
    through veterinarians and specialty pet retailers.
