description: Uber Technologies is a technology provider that matches riders with drivers,
    hungry people with restaurants and food couriers, and shippers with carriers.
    The firm's on-demand technology platform is currently utilized by traditional
    cars as well as autonomous vehicles, but could eventually be used for additional
    products and services, such as delivery via drones or electronic vehicle take-off
    and landing (eVTOL) technology. Uber operates in over 70 countries, with over
    180 million users who order rides or food at least once a month.
