description: Reddit is a social media platform where users can engage in conversations,
    explore, and create communities centered around their interests. Founded in 2005
    by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, Reddit has evolved into a vast network of
    user-generated content organized into specialized forums known as "subreddits."
    The platform's unique community-driven model relies on volunteer moderators to
    manage content and maintain subreddit guidelines. Reddit generates revenue through
    advertising, Premium Memberships, and data licensing agreements.
