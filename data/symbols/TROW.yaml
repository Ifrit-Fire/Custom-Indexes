description: T. Rowe Price provides asset management services for individual and institutional
    investors. It offers a broad range of no-load US and international stock, hybrid,
    bond, and money market funds. At the end of June 2025, the firm had $1.667 trillion
    in managed assets, composed of equity (50%), balanced (35%), fixed-income and
    money market (12%), and alternative (3%) offerings. Approximately two thirds of
    managed assets are held in retirement-based accounts, which provides T. Rowe Price
    with a somewhat stickier client base than most of its peers. The firm also manages
    private accounts, provides retirement planning advice, and offers discount brokerage
    and trust services. The company is primarily a US-based asset manager, deriving
    less than 10% of its AUM from overseas.
