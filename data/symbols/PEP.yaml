description: PepsiCo is a global leader in snacks and beverages, owning well-known
    household brands including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lay's, Cheetos, and
    Doritos, among others. The company dominates the global savory snacks market and
    also ranks as the second-largest beverage provider in the world (behind Coca-Cola)
    with diversified exposure to carbonated soft drinks, or CSD, as well as water,
    sports, and energy drink offerings. Convenience foods account for approximately
    55% of its total revenue, with beverages making up the rest. Pepsi owns the bulk
    of its manufacturing and distribution capacity in the US, but uses bottlers overseas
    for beverages. International markets made up 40% of both total sales and operating
    profits in 2024.
