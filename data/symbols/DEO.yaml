description: Formed in 1997 through the merger of Grand Metropolitan and Guinness,
    Diageo is the largest distiller globally by sales. Diageo acquired some of the
    Seagram assets in 2001, which gave it brands such as Captain Morgan rum and Crown
    Royal Canadian whisky. Since then, mergers and acquisitions have mostly been bolt-on
    in nature, plugging gaps in the company's product and geographic portfolio. The
    firm has also shed noncore brands over the years, including the majority of its
    wine assets in 2015.
