description: "The merger of the Dutch postal bank and NN Insurance in 1991 created\
    \ ING. Through a series of further acquisitions, ING built up a global footprint.\
    \ The 2008 financial crisis forced ING to seek government support\u2014a precondition\
    \ of which was that ING should separate its banking and insurance activities,\
    \ which saw ING revert to being solely a bank. ING has market-leading banking\
    \ operations in the Netherlands and Belgium, and a range of digital banks across\
    \ Europe and Australia. Its global wholesale banking operation is primarily focused\
    \ on lending."
