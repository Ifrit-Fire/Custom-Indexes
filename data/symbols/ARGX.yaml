description: Argenx is a Dutch biopharmaceutical company focused on developing antibody-based
    therapies for rare autoimmune diseases. The company's lead product, Vyvgart (efgartigimod),
    was approved by the FDA in December 2021 for the treatment of generalized myasthenia
    gravis (gMG). In 2022, Argenx also received FDA approval for Vyvgart Hytrulo,
    a subcutaneous formulation of Vyvgart, offering a more convenient option compared
    with Vyvgart's intravenous administration. In 2024, the FDA approved Vyvgart Hytrulo
    for Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, a rare immune-mediated
    neuromuscular disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Argenx is focused on
    innovation and developing its pipeline for treatments such as primary immune thrombocytopenia,
    thyroid eye disease, and Sjogren's Disease.
