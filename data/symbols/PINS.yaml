    discovery. Pinterest users, or pinners, can leverage the platform as they go about
    gathering ideas on topics such as home improvement, fashion, cooking, and travel.
    The company has more than 500 million monthly active users, two thirds of whom
    are female. Pinterest generates revenue by selling digital ads on its platform.
    While the platform's user base spans the globe, the vast majority of its revenue
    stems from ads shown to North American users.
