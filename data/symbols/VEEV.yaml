    operating and regulatory requirements for customers ranging from small, emerging
    biotechnology companies to departments of global pharmaceutical manufacturers.

    of the underserved life sciences industry, displacing large, highly customized
    and dated enterprise resource planning systems that have limited flexibility.
    Its two main products are Veeva CRM, a customer relationship management platform
    for companies with a salesforce, and Veeva Vault, a content management platform
    that tackles various functions within any life sciences company.
