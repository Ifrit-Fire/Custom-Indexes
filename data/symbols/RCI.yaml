description: Rogers Communications is the largest wireless service provider in Canada,
    with more than 11 million subscribers equating to one-third of the total Canadian
    market. Rogers' wireless business accounts for more than half of total revenue
    and has been growing at a higher rate than other segments. Rogers' cable segment,
    which provides about 38% of total revenue after acquiring Shaw, offers home internet,
    television, and landline phone service to consumers and businesses. Remaining
    sales come from Rogers' media unit, which owns and operates various television
    and radio stations and the Toronto Blue Jays. Rogers' significant exposure to
    sports also includes ownership stakes in the Toronto Maple Leafs, Raptors, FC,
    and Argonauts.
