description: Molson Coors owns well-known beer brands including Miller, Coors, Blue
    Moon, and Carling and ranks as the second-largest beer maker in both value and
    volume terms in the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Through licensing agreements,
    the firm also brews and distributes beer and hard seltzer under partner brands
    from Heineken, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Asahi, and Coca-Cola. The brewer uses independent
    distributors in the US, given the three-tier distribution requirements, while
    using a combination of distributors and an in-house sales team in Canada and Europe.
    North America remains its largest market, contributing over 80% of total revenue.
