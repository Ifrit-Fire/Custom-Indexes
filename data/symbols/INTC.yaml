description: Intel is a leading digital chipmaker, focused on the design and manufacturing
    of microprocessors for the global personal computer and data center markets. Intel
    pioneered the x86 architecture for microprocessors and was the prime proponent
    of Moore's law for advances in semiconductor manufacturing. Intel remains the
    market share leader in central processing units in both the PC and server end
    markets. Intel has also been expanding into new adjacencies, such as communications
    infrastructure, automotive, and the Internet of Things. Further, Intel expects
    to leverage its chip manufacturing capabilities into an outsourced foundry model
    where it constructs chips for others.
